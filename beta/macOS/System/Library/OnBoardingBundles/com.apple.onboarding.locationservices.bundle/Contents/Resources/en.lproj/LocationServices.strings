For example, an app might use your location data and location search query to help you find nearby coffee shops or theaters, or your device may set its time zone automatically based on your current location.

To use features such as these, you must enable Location Services on your iPad and give your permission to each app or website before it can receive location data from Location Services. Apps may request limited access to your location data (only when you are using the app or approximate location) or full access (even when you are not using the app or precise location).

For safety purposes, however, your iPad’s location information may be used when an emergency call is placed to aid response efforts regardless of whether you enable Location Services.

Location Services uses device sensors, including GPS and Bluetooth (where those are available), along with crowd-sourced WLAN hotspot and cell tower locations to determine your device’s location.

By enabling Location Services, location-based system services such as these will also be enabled:

• Routing and Traffic: While you are in transit (for example, walking or driving), your iPad will periodically send GPS data, travel speed and direction, and barometric pressure information in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to be used for augmenting crowd-sourced road traffic, roadway, pedestrian walkway, and atmospheric correction databases. Additionally, when you open an app near a point of interest (for example, a business or park) your iPad will send location data in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple which Apple may aggregate and use to let users know if that point of interest is open and how busy it is.

• Significant Locations & Routes: Your iPad and other devices where you sign in to iCloud with your Apple Account will keep track of places you have recently been, how often and when you visited them, and the routes you take to get there, in order to learn places and routes that are significant to you. Your Significant Locations & Routes are synced between your devices using end-to-end encryption and cannot be read by Apple. They are used to provide you with personalized services, such as building better Memories in Photos, and to enable you to share your Visited Places and your Preferred Routes and Predicted Destinations (where available) to support features like predictive route suggestions.

• Improve Location Accuracy: Your iPad will periodically send the geo-tagged locations of nearby WLAN hotspots and cell towers (where supported by a device) in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to be used for augmenting this crowd-sourced database of WLAN hotspot and cell tower locations.

• Suggestions & Search: The location of your iPad will be sent to Apple to provide more relevant recommendations. If you turn off Location Services for location-based suggestions, your precise location will not be sent to Apple. To deliver relevant search suggestions and news, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.

• Alerts & Shortcuts Automations: Your iPad will use your location in order to provide you with geographically relevant alerts, such as a reminder to call someone when you get to a specific place, when to leave for your next appointment, or an app or shortcut recommendation based on where you currently are.

• Share My Location: You can choose to share your current location with others, on a temporary or ongoing basis, from within certain apps such as Messages and Find My.

• Home Accessories: Your iPad will use your location to control accessories when you arrive at or leave a specific location, such as turning on your lights when you get home or setting your thermostat to your preferred temperature before you arrive home.

• System Customization: Your iPad will customize system appearance, behaviors, and settings using your current location, for example by automatically enabling Optimized Battery Charging when you are at home. This customization data does not leave your device.
