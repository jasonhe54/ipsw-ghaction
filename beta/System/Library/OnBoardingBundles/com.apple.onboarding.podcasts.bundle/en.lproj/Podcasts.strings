We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better, and when we do collect data, we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Apple Podcasts, like every Apple product and service, is designed with these principles in mind.

Providing and Improving Apple Podcasts

We collect data about podcast listening and interactions in order to provide and improve the service, and to understand and provide aggregate reports about podcast listenership. This data includes information about the podcasts you listen to, such as how much of a podcast you listen to, when you listen, and when you stream, download, or follow. To help improve and personalize the service, we collect information about your interactions with Apple Podcasts, such as selections you make. We designed Apple Podcasts so that this data is not linked to other Apple services. This information is associated with a random unique identifier that is specific to Apple Podcasts and not stored with your Apple Account. We use iCloud Keychain to sync the identifier across your devices that have iCloud Keychain enabled. To reset the identifier included in playback data sent to Apple on tvOS, go to Settings > Apps > Podcasts > Reset Identifier.

As a convenience to you, Apple Podcasts syncs your favorite categories, the play position of the podcast episodes you are listening to, and the contents of your library, including the shows you follow, the episodes you have saved, and your stations so that you can enjoy the same Apple Podcasts experience from any of your devices. This information is stored in association with your Apple Account. You can disable syncing of your library in Settings.

We use information about your favorite categories, channel subscriptions, followed Podcasts, recent Podcast plays, and recent recommendations to personalize the service and help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. You can disable personalization in Apple Podcasts, as well as in the App Store, Apple Books, the iTunes Store, Apple TV, and for subscriptions from Apple, by turning off Personalized Recommendations for your Apple Account. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Media & Purchases > View Account, and then tap to turn off Personalized Recommendations.

We share data with podcast providers only in aggregate form. We do not share any of your personal data with third parties. Keep in mind, however, that when you play or download podcast episodes from some podcast providers, those providers may be able to collect information about your use of their podcasts, and that collection is governed by their policies and privacy practices. For example, when you add a show by URL or listen to a podcast that is hosted by a third-party hosting platform, your device connects directly to the third-party hosting platform to provide you with the requested content. When it connects, your device’s IP address will be visible to the third-party hosting platform. The handling of your IP address by the third-party hosting platform is governed by the privacy policies of this third party.

Other apps and devices that offer Apple Podcasts integrations may request access to Apple Podcasts and your Podcasts Library. If you give such permission to an app or device integration, it can access information like your library, your podcast play activity, and your recommendations. A permitted app or device can also modify data associated with your account, such as which podcasts are in your library. You can disable an iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS app’s access on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Media & Apple Music. You can disable access by other apps or devices in your Apple Music account settings.

Communicating with You

Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about Apple Podcasts and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. Apple may also use information about your purchase activity within Apple Podcasts to send you emails and push notifications about new features, content, and offers available on Apple Podcasts. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to account.apple.com. To update your notification preferences on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > Podcasts. Apple uses information about your interactions with our communications, including notifications, to improve our services.

Apple Podcasts Subscriptions

If you purchase podcasts subscriptions from Apple Podcasts, we will use personal data that is necessary to process your purchase transactions, such as your account and payment information, which you can access and change in Settings, and your purchase history. We may also use your personal data to check whether you are eligible for a free trial or special offer from Apple Podcasts.

We use information about your active subscriptions to Apple services and third-party apps purchased through the App Store to check whether you are entitled to access additional subscribed content in Apple Podcasts. If you have previously purchased a subscription directly from a third party with available content, you will be able to verify your subscription with the third party and get access to such content.

Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity

When you use a payment card, Apple may retain and automatically update your card number and billing information for future purchases, recurring transactions, or other uses you authorize. Apple may obtain this information from your financial institution or payment network, and also use it for fraud prevention and verification. Apple may also use information about your historical business relationship with Apple to process Apple Podcasts subscription renewals and to determine whether to provide ongoing access to your subscriptions in advance of authorization by the payment partner.

We will also compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt a purchase using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers.

Apple may use information about your use of Apple Podcasts to prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of the tvOS Software License Agreement or applicable law.

For most customers, that requires at least a 10-year retention period, but in regions such as China that period can be 30 years. We also retain a record of your purchases for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to access that content, again in line with our applicable terms. Some information, such as transactions but not your stored card details, may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using Apple Podcasts.
