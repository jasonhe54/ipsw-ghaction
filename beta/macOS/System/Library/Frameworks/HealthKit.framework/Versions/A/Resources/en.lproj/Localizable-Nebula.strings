Body position, alcohol intake, upper respiratory illnesses, and even some medications can lead to increased breathing disturbances on a night-to-night basis.
An elevated number of disturbances for multiple nights may indicate a condition called sleep apnea.
When turned on, Apple Watch can track your breathing disturbances each night and categorize them as Not Elevated or Elevated.
If you’re diagnosed with sleep apnea, you should not make any changes to your treatments without talking to your doctor first.";
