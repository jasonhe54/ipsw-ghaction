"FOOTER_TEXT" = "With Emergency SOS, you can quickly and easily call for help and alert your emergency contacts. When you make a call with Emergency SOS, your device automatically calls the local emergency number. In some countries and regions, you might need to choose the service that you want to be designated as your emergency service. To allow the dispatcher to assist you, this call may include your location, regardless of whether you enable Location Services. Once the call ends, you can choose to notify your emergency contacts with a message that says you have called emergency services. This message also includes your current location. You can manage your emergency contacts by editing your Medical ID in the Health app on iPhone.

For a limited period of time, your device will send updates to your emergency contacts as your location changes using the Messages app. You’ll receive a notification when this happens. When you use Emergency SOS on your Apple Watch, you can stop these updates by tapping Stop Sharing in the notification on your Apple Watch. When you use Emergency SOS on your iPhone, you can stop these updates by tapping the status bar on your iPhone and selecting Stop Sharing Emergency Location.

If Location Services is disabled, it will be temporarily enabled in order to notify your emergency contacts with your location. When your location is being shared, you’ll get a reminder to stop every four hours for 24 hours. If you don’t want to send your location to your emergency contacts, on your iPhone go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services, and tap to turn off Emergency Calls & SOS.";
