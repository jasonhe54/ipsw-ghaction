"ATRIAL_FIBRILLATION_BURDEN_SUMMARY" = "This represents how often your heart is in atrial fibrillation (AFib), a common irregular rhythm. It can help you understand if your AFib is becoming more or less frequent and if life factors, such as exercise or sleep, have an impact on it.
If you’re already diagnosed with AFib, Apple Watch can track your heart rhythm and the Health app can estimate your AFib History each week. The percentage estimate is based on seven days of readings taken by Apple Watch and does not indicate if your heart is in AFib at any given moment.
Do not make any changes to your medications without discussing those changes with your doctor first.
Apple Watch cannot detect a heart attack or stroke.";
