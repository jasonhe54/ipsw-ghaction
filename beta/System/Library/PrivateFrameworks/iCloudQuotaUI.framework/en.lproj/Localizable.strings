Normally, when you browse the web, your local network can use your DNS records to see the names of the websites you’re visiting. In addition, the websites you visit may collect your IP address, which allows them to determine your identity and approximate location without your explicit permission. All of this information can be aggregated over time into a detailed profile about you that may be used for targeted advertising and other purposes.
To help solve this problem, Private Relay protects users’ web browsing in Safari, DNS resolution queries, and insecure http app traffic. It routes the traffic through two separate internet relays that hide your IP address and encrypt your web traffic such that no single party—including Apple—can see both who you are and what sites you’re visiting.
Private Relay is available to all iCloud+ subscribers. You can turn it on or off any time from your iCloud settings.";
