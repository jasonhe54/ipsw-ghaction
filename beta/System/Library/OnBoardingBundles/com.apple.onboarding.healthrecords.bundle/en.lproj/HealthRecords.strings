"FOOTER_TEXT" = "Health Records allows you to automatically download health records to your iPhone or iPad through a direct connection with your healthcare provider. Any health records you receive in connection with this feature are stored in encrypted form and protected with your passcode on your device.

In order to help you find your healthcare providers that might support Health Records, Apple can search for your providers by name. With your consent, the location of your device will also be used to provide geographically relevant results. Once you have located your healthcare provider, you will be asked to authenticate with your patient login information. Health records will automatically be downloaded to your iPhone or iPad. Your device will use a secure token that will be used to receive health records. The Health app does not store your patient login information.

Your Health app data, including health records, will be kept up to date across your devices automatically using iCloud, where it is encrypted while in transit and at rest. To disable this feature, go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud and tap to turn off Health.

You can stop receiving health records at any time by removing your account. To do so, open the Health app, tap the Browse tab, tap your Profile, tap Health Records, and select the account you want to remove, then tap Remove Account. By removing your account, the records associated with that account will be deleted from your devices.

If you experience any issues with your patient login information or with the content of your health records, contact your healthcare provider.

The health records you download on your iPhone or iPad may not reflect your complete medical history and should not be used as a substitute for your official health records or any professional medical judgment. You should consult with your healthcare provider prior to making any decisions related to your health.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy";
