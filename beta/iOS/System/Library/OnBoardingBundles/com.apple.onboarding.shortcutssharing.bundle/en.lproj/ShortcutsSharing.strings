Shortcuts that are downloaded from the web or shared with you by others may not have been reviewed by Apple, and Apple has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content or functionality of those shortcuts. You should review all shortcuts downloaded from the web or shared with you with extra caution to confirm that they function as you expect.

You control which shortcuts access your personal data, such as your location (precise or approximate), contacts, health data, payment information, or the contents of your documents. You can review and control the data that a shortcut has access to in the details section for that shortcut.

Shortcuts You Share Will Be Sent to Apple

If you create and share a shortcut, your shared shortcut, along with any content embedded in it, will be sent to Apple to enable sharing at your direction. The shortcut, and its contents, will be available to anyone who gains access to the shared web link, who then may copy, save, modify, and redistribute a copy of your shared shortcut and all contents embedded in it. You should not create and share shortcuts that contain contents you do not have the necessary rights to, or shortcuts that violate someone else’s rights or the law. Apple has no obligation to review any shortcuts you share, although Apple may review, disable, or remove any shortcuts you share.

Apple also collects aggregated information about shared shortcuts, such as the number of shortcuts shared, in a way that does not personally identify you to improve Shortcuts.

You have the option to enable shortcuts sharing in the Shortcuts app settings.

Shortcuts sync across your devices using iCloud. If you don’t want shortcuts to sync, you can disable this feature on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Saved to iCloud > See All and tapping to turn off Shortcuts, or by going to Settings > Apps > Shortcuts and tapping to turn off iCloud Sync. On Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] > iCloud > Saved to iCloud > See All and deselect Shortcuts, or in the Shortcuts app, go to Settings and deselect iCloud Sync.

Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, or as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
