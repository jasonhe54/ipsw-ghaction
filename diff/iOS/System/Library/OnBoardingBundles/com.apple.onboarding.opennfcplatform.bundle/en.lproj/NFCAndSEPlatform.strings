Using the NFC & SE Platform

Determining Availability
When you attempt to provision a credential to your preferred contactless app using the NFC & SE Platform, your device, but not Apple, will use information about your location and device settings to ensure NFC & SE Platform availability. If your device cannot determine availability, you may be unable to add a credential to your contactless app. Your device will also use information about your location to determine the availability of certain default contactless app preferences, and will display available preferences in Settings > Apps > [app name] > Default Contactless App. Changing your default contactless app preferences when you are not in a region where NFC & SE Platform is supported may prevent you from using your preferred contactless app to present a credential when the NFC & SE Platform is not available.

Adding Credentials to Your Device
When you add a credential to your preferred contactless app, Apple will use your Apple Account and your device’s hardware identifiers to securely provision the credential to your Secure Element. Apple will use and store this information to allow Apple, your contactless app provider, and your credential issuer to manage the credential in the contactless app, such as updating or deleting your provisioned credential. Information used to manage the lifecycle of your credentials includes data about how the credential issuer has configured your credential, and information about the provider of the contactless app. Apple does not see or store your credential details when you use the NFC & SE Platform with your preferred contactless app.

Information Shared with Apple for Billing Purposes
When you provision a credential to your contactless app using the NFC & SE Platform or use that credential, Apple will use information that cannot be tied back to you to bill your contactless app provider. Your device will share limited information about the quantity and type of credentials added to your contactless app, and a count of each time you’ve presented your credentials. Your device will share this information to Apple in a way not tied to you for billing purposes only. Apple does not see or store your transaction information when you present a credential from your contactless app.
