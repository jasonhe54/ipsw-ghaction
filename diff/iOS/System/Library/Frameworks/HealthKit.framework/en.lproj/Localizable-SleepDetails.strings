Each sleep session can be scored and classified on a scale: Very High, High, OK, Low, or Very Low. The measurement is based on several aspects of your sleep—the overall duration, the number of times you wake up and for how long, as well as if you get to sleep close to your typical bedtime.
The classification is not necessarily an indication of how you feel when you wake up, but can give you a sense of whether or not your body got the sleep it needs to rest and restore itself.
Tracking your sleep can also give you an overall sense of your sleep patterns, how restful your sleep is, and how your habits might be helping or hurting your sleep.
Sleep score relies on data from a sleep monitoring device such as Apple Watch.";
