"SLEEPING_WRIST_TEMPERATURE_SUMMARY" = "Wrist temperature is a measurement related to your body’s temperature taken by Apple Watch while you’re sleeping. Your data is shown as a change from baseline, an average of recent measurements taken during sleep. While everyone’s wrist temperature baseline is different, tracking nightly changes in your wrist temperature can provide insight into your well-being.
Your body temperature naturally fluctuates, and can vary from night to night due to variables like diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption, or physiological factors like menstrual cycles and illness. Wrist temperature can also be impacted by external factors like your sleep environment. Values within 1.8°F (1°C) of your baseline are common.
Each wrist temperature value is an average of several measurements taken during sleep when Sleep Focus is turned on.";
