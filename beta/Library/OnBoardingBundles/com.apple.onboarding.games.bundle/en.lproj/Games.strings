"FOOTER_TEXT" = "The Apple Games app allows you to discover new games and engage in gaming activities such as participating in leaderboards and multiplayer games, finding, viewing, and challenging friends, and tracking achievements.

In order to provide the best experience for you, the Games app combines information from and about your use of the App Store, Apple Arcade, and Game Center as well as information from your device about the game-related apps you launch. To get started with the Games app, you will need to sign in to your Game Center account and agree to allow Apple to combine your activity across these services. You can change your choice at any time by going to Settings > Apple Games. However, if you do not agree to Apple Games using information from these other services, you will not be able to use the Games app.

Providing the Games App

The Games app uses information about the game-related apps you’ve downloaded (from the App Store, within the Apple Games app, and on Mac) as well as Game Center and on-device information about which of these apps you’ve most recently played or launched to power experiences like those on the Home tab and your Game Library. We use this information to show you your games apps all in one place and allow you to easily pick up where you left off.

When you download a game-related app from within the Games app or the App Store, identifiers such as your device’s hardware ID and IP address are logged by Apple along with your Apple Account. Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location in order to determine whether certain apps that are subject to legal restrictions in some regions can be made available to you.

Profiles
Your Game Center profile, including your nickname, avatar, your friends list and your gaming activity will be available within the Games app. Any privacy settings you have turned on for your Game Center profile and activity will also apply in Apple Games. Tapping on a player’s avatar will take you to the profile page for that player. On the profile page you may request to be friends, if you aren’t already, or contact the player if your and their settings allow.

Friends
Friend suggestions within the Games app are based on challenges and multiplayer games played together as well as the number of games and friends you have in common. In addition, if your Game Center nickname is linked with your Contact card, your email address and phone number associated with your Apple Account are used to help friends find you. And if your Contacts have their Game Center nickname linked with their Contact card, that information is used along with on-device processing to enhance friends recommendations for you.

Challenges
Challenges is a feature of the Apple Games app that allows you and your Game Center friends to play your favorite games together. We use information about your Game Center friends to show you which friends are playing the games you play or are interested in, to help you find new friends with friend suggestions, and to recommend challenges to play together.

Charts
Aggregated information about the Game Center-enabled games you and others play is used to power charts within the Games app and on the App Store.

Personalizing the Games App

To provide you with the best gaming experience all in one place, we personalize your experience within Games. To do this, we use information about you from the App Store, Apple Arcade, and Game Center, as well as on-device information about your game app usage.

App Store
We use your interactions with the App Store to help you discover the games that are most relevant to you. For example, we recommend games and in-app events that we think will be of interest to you based on what you’ve previously searched for, viewed, downloaded, updated, or reviewed in the App Store and the Games app. We also use your purchase history, including in-app purchases, subscriptions, and payment methods together with account information derived from your Apple Account, such as the devices you use and new devices you activate. To make better recommendations, we also use aggregate information about app launches, installs, and deletions from users who choose to share device analytics with Apple, as well as aggregate information about app ratings. The information Apple receives about your usage of the App Store and Games includes information about the personalized content you tap and view.

You can turn off personalization features in the App Store and for certain other services by turning off Personalized Recommendations for your Apple Account. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Media & Purchases > View Account, then tap to turn off Personalized Recommendations. When Personalized Recommendations is turned off, the Games app will not use the information described above from the App Store to make recommendations to you in the Games app, but we will still show you the games apps you’ve downloaded as part of your Games app Library.

Arcade
When you are subscribed to Apple Arcade, the Games app will include the Arcade games you have downloaded and play and the Apple Arcade apps that are available to you as part of your subscription. We also use information about your Apple Arcade activity to help inform recommendations for other games that may be of interest to you.

Game Center
Your Game Center activity, including the Game Center-enabled games you play, and Game Center challenges, achievements, and leaderboards are used in combination with your App Store activity to recommend games, challenges, in-app events, and friends to you.

On-Device App Usage
To provide a better user experience, we access information on your device about the game-related apps you have launched and how recently you have launched them to sort your games by recency of engagement.

Improving the Games App

To improve and optimize the experience in the Games app and related services, we collect information about your usage of the app as well as the App Store, Apple Arcade, and Game Center. This information includes when you open and close these apps and services, the content and games you search for, view, and download, your interactions with notifications and badges, and your purchases within game-related apps. We also collect information about your device, such as the type of device, version of your operating system, and amount of free space on your device. We combine and use this information to understand how you and others engage with the features of the Games app and related services in order to improve these apps and services and guide the development of new Games-related features and functionality.

Your Games app usage information is associated with a random unique identifier that is specific to your use of Apple Games and is not stored with your Apple Account. To reset the identifier on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Apps > Games > Reset Identifier. On Mac, go to Games > Reset Identifier.

Children in the Games App

The Apple Games app respects child settings and parental controls. Game Center privacy settings and the Screen Time Content & Privacy Restrictions for children will apply to activities in the Games app. Personalized Recommendations settings are also respected. To limit time spent in specific game-related apps and block Game Center features on your child’s device, including multiplayer functionality, the ability to add friends, and the ability to connect with friends playing the same game on your iOS, iPadOS, visionOS device, or Mac, go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > App Store, Media, Web, & Games and scroll to the Game Center section. On tvOS, go to Settings > General > Restrictions.

When communicating with other players via Game Center, children cannot send or receive user-inputted text. They are restricted to sending and receiving preset messages. In-game voice chat is also disabled for children in Game Center-enabled apps. However, for games apps that are not Game Center-enabled or where functionality outside of Game Center is being used, the in-app controls for those apps and the policies of those apps will apply.

Communicating with You

Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about the Games app and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. Apple may also use information about your activity within the Games app, the App Store, Apple Arcade, and Game Center to send you communications about new features, content, in-app events, challenges, leaderboards, and offers available on Games.

Email Marketing
You may receive these communications by email, if you consent to receive email marketing. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to account.apple.com, or on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > Personal Information > Communication Preferences.

Notifications
You may also receive these communications through push, banner, or badge notifications delivered by Game Center. To update your notification preferences or to opt out of notifications on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > Game Center. Apple uses information about your interactions with our communications, including notifications, to improve our services.

Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

We process your personal data in the Apple Games app generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service, and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable local law.

Where applicable local law provides, we process personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party in order to:

• Display relevant content, assess whether your device has enough space to download requested content, and facilitate automatic downloads of updated content
• Personalize your experience in the Games app
• Improve and optimize the Games app and other related Apple products and services for you and others
• Send you offers via email, push, banner, and badge notifications that may be of interest to you
• Provide reporting to developers on downloads and purchases in their apps
• Prevent fraud and other malicious activity

The data used includes:

• Your use of the Games app, such as your downloads and purchases, as well as Game Center notifications and messages and in-app notifications and messages
• Details about your device and account
• Your IP address
• The device trust score

Retention

We retain personal data associated with your purchases and downloads on the Games app and App Store for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting, which vary by region. For most customers, that requires at least a 10-year retention period but in regions such as China, that period can be 30 years. We also retain a record of your purchase and downloads of content for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to download that content, again in line with our applicable terms. We retain other information such as browsing activity and searches for a shorter period. The period chosen takes account of applicable legal requirements to retain data and specific business use cases. However, some information, such as purchases but not your stored card details, may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the Games app.

When you use a payment card, Apple may retain and automatically update your card number and billing information for future purchases, recurring transactions, or other uses you authorize. Apple may obtain this information from your financial institution or payment network, and also use it for fraud prevention and verification.

Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity

We collect personal data to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Apple Games app, the App Store, Apple Arcade, Game Center, and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information (approximated by matching the IP address of your internet connection to a geographic region, if available), download and purchase history, searches, and other interactions with these services.

When you initiate a purchase, or when a subscription is set to auto-renew, Apple may use information about your historical business relationship with Apple to process the request and determine whether to provide the product or service in advance of authorization by the payment partner.

We also compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt a purchase using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers.
