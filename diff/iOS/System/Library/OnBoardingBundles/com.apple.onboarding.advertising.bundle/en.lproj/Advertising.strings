Contextual Information

Contextual information may be used to serve ads to you, such as:

• Device Information: Your keyboard language settings, device type, OS version, and connection type.

• Device Location: If Location Services is turned on and you’ve granted permission to the App Store, Apple News, or Apple TV app to access your location, your approximate location may be used to serve you geographically relevant ads. Apple’s advertising platform does not construct profiles from your location, and does not use or store your precise location even if you allow an app to access your precise location. To access these settings, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services.

• App Store: Your query when you perform a search, and information about the page you are viewing may be used to serve you a relevant ad.

• Apple News and Stocks: The type of story you read may be used to select appropriate ads.

Segments

We create segments to deliver personalized ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks. Segments are groups of people who share similar characteristics. Information about you may be used to determine which segments you’re assigned to, and thus, which ads you receive. To protect your privacy, personalized ads are delivered only if more than 5,000 people meet the targeting criteria selected by an advertiser.

We may use information such as the following to assign you to segments:

• Account Information: Your name, address, age, gender, and devices registered to your Apple Account. Information such as your first name in your Apple Account registration page or salutation in your Apple Account may be used to derive your gender. You can update your account information on the Apple Account website at account.apple.com.

• Downloads, Purchases & Subscriptions: The music, movies, books, TV shows, and apps you download, as well as any in-app purchases and subscriptions. We don’t allow targeting based on downloads of a specific app or purchases within a specific app (including subscriptions) from the App Store, unless the targeting is done by that app’s developer.

• Apple News and Stocks: The topics and categories of the stories you read and the publications you follow, subscribe to, or turn on notifications from.

• Advertising: Your interactions with ads delivered by Apple’s advertising platform.

When selecting which ad to display from multiple ads for which you are eligible, we may use some of the above-mentioned information, as well as your App Store searches and browsing activity, to determine which ad is likely to be most relevant to you. App Store browsing activity includes the content and apps you tap and view while browsing the App Store. This information is aggregated across users so that it does not identify you. We may also use local, on-device processing to select which ad to display, using information stored on your device, such as the apps you frequently open.

Apple’s advertising platform receives information about the ads you tap and view against a random identifier not tied to your Apple Account.

Apple does not share any personal data with third parties. We make certain non-personal data available to our advertisers and strategic partners that work with Apple to provide our products and services, help Apple market to customers, and sell ads on Apple’s behalf. No Apple Pay transactions or Health app data is accessible to Apple’s advertising platform, or is used for advertising purposes. Apple does not know or make available to advertisers information about your sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or political affiliations.

About This Ad
To understand why a specific ad was shown to you on the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks, tap the Ad button on the ad. This will present the segments and other data, such as demographic information, that were used to determine which ad you received.

Certain ads may contain only “Presented by” or similar language instead of the Ad button to signal that an advertiser is sponsoring an entire feed or page, but no segments are used to target these placements.

You can opt out of location-based app functionality including for advertising. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services, and either turn off Location Services or, where applicable, set the App Store, Apple News, or Apple TV app permission to Never.

You can turn off Personalized Ads on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising, and deselect Personalized Ads.
