"FOOTER_TEXT" = "iCloud Keychain stores website usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and expiration dates you save with iCloud and keeps them up to date across all your iOS 7 or later devices and your Macs running OS X Mavericks (10.9) or later that you have approved.

When you turn on iCloud Keychain, the Safari AutoFill feature will prompt you to save your username, password, or credit card information when you enter it. Once saved, the username, password, or credit card information will autofill so that you don’t have to enter it again. Safari AutoFill and iCloud Keychain will not store your credit card security code. For example, when making a purchase in Safari, select the credit card you want to use and Safari will automatically complete the credit card number and expiration date. You’ll still need to enter your security code to complete the purchase. Safari’s Password Generator can also suggest unique, hard-to-guess passwords for your online accounts and use iCloud Keychain to store these passwords. If you restore your device from a backup, iCloud Keychain can automatically sign in to your saved accounts. For more information about setting up iCloud Keychain, visit support.apple.com/109016.

Your iCloud Keychain is encrypted when transmitted to your devices and when stored in iCloud, and cannot be read by Apple.";
