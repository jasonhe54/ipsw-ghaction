"ELS_HEALTH_CONSENT_ACTIN_CONTENT" = "This diagnostic session collects logs that allow Apple to troubleshoot issues with how your heart rate is established on your Apple Watch and/or iPhone from your AirPods.

The generated files from your Apple Watch and/or iPhone may include data such as heart rate measurements (workout heart rate, breathe heart rate, resting heart rate, sleep heart rate, blood oxygen heart rate, and background heart rate), high/low heart rate alert information, wrist state (on/off wrist), workout data (such as heart rate and calorimetry), blood oxygen saturation level, barometric pressure, sessions state changes, beat-to-beat heart rate measurements, optical sensor data (such as indicative of heart rate and wrist detection), heart rate notification settings, sleep related settings and results, respiration rate data, logs indicating motion, heart rate confidences, bluetooth discovery updates, workout activity types, heart rate sources (device), and device timezone information. Additionally, firmware logs including raw heart rate sensor data, optical sensor for in ear detection and force sensor for stem click & volume swipe and calibration data, case tap and bud tap algorithm logs may be collected from your AirPod sensors.

The logs will include current and historic log data dating from when you first began using the logs related to your use of this feature. You will be able to turn off logging at any time while the logs are being collected by tapping the close icon (x) and selecting “End Upload” to exit the logging session. You can also turn off logging by navigating to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > View Enhanced Logging Session > tap the close icon (x) > and select “End Upload”. You will be able to review the log files prior to sending them to Apple. Your data will be retained for as long as necessary to troubleshoot issues and to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, but no longer than the life of the device plus 10 years.

By agreeing to this consent, you are consenting to Apple’s and its subsidiaries and agent’s collection, use, transmissions, and processing of the content of data as necessary to identify and troubleshoot issues with this feature, as well as needed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Your data may be transferred to and stored in the United States. You may revoke consent at any time by exiting the application during logging.

At all times, information received by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
