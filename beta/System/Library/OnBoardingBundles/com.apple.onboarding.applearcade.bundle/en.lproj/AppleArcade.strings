Providing Apple Arcade

Apple uses your personal data to provide the services and features in Apple Arcade. This information includes your account and payment information, which you can access and change in Settings or System Settings, and your App Store purchase history.

As a convenience for you, Apple Arcade uses iCloud to keep aspects of your experience up to date on all of your devices. For example, Apple Arcade will use iCloud to sync your progress in a game across your devices. You can disable this capability at any time by turning off iCloud for Arcade games in Settings on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device or in System Settings on Mac. If a game developer uses iCloud Backup, your game progress will still be backed up to iCloud if you have enabled iCloud Backup.

When you sign in to Game Center, Apple will receive your gameplay activity, including scores and achievements, challenges, and multiplayer gameplay. Additionally, your Arcade subscription state is visible to all Game Center users. You can learn more about Game Center and privacy by going to www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/game-center.

Improving and Personalizing Apple Arcade

Apple collects limited information about the games you play each week associated with your Apple Account. We also collect certain non-personal data about your gameplay activity, including gameplay in Apple Arcade App Clips, that is not associated with your Apple Account. We use the information we collect to improve and optimize Apple Arcade and other gaming-related Apple services for you and others, and to personalize your experience in Apple Arcade, the App Store, and other gaming-related Apple services to help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we recommend games that we think will be of interest to you based on games you’ve previously played or purchased in the App Store. Personalization features can be disabled by turning off Personalized Recommendations for your Apple Account in the App Store Settings.

Apple Arcade and Apple Games

If you use the Apple Games app, the above information about how you use Apple Arcade, as described in the Improving and Personalizing Apple Arcade section, will be used by the Apple Games app to personalize your experience in Apple Games, optimize and improve Apple Arcade and Apple Games, and send you communications. For more information about the Apple Games app, visit www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-games.

Communicating with You

Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about Apple Arcade and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, including Apple One. Your device serial number may be used to check eligibility for service offers. If you are in a Family Sharing group, Apple may send you communications about products, services, and offers available to you through Family Sharing. If you purchase an Apple One subscription, we may send you emails and notifications about the features of each of the services for which you have subscribed. Apple may also use information about your activity within the App Store and Arcade to send you emails and notifications about new features, content, and offers available in the App Store and Arcade. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to account.apple.com. To update your notification preferences on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > App Store. Apple uses information about your interactions with our communications, including notifications, to improve our services.

Sharing with Third Parties

We provide aggregated, non-personal data about gaming activity to Apple Arcade content providers, so that they can assess and improve player engagement with their game.

If your mobile network provider offers Apple Arcade subscriptions and free trials, Apple may check your phone number to determine if you have or are eligible for an Apple Arcade subscription through your mobile network provider. If you signed up through your mobile network provider or another Apple partner, Apple will use your phone number or a unique account identifier shared by the partner to identify your account and to let the mobile network provider or other partner know that you have activated your subscription. We will use the phone number or unique identifier associated with your subscription to verify your account at sign in and to connect your Apple Arcade subscription with your account.

Data Collection by Third-Party Content Providers

Content providers that provide Arcade games are required to obtain your permission to collect your personal data. Content providers may use your personal data only for the purposes they state when obtaining your permission. You should review the Apple Arcade content providers’ terms, privacy policies, and practices to understand how they collect and use your data.

Advertising

If the Personalized Ads setting is turned on, Apple’s advertising platform may use your information to serve ads that are more relevant to you. We may use information about the Arcade apps you download to ensure that ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks are relevant. If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can choose to turn off Personalized Ads. Turning off Personalized Ads will prevent Apple from using your information for ad targeting. It may not decrease the number of ads you receive, but the ads may be less relevant to you.

Retention

We retain personal data associated with your transactions, downloads, and gameplay activity in Apple Arcade only for as long as we have a business need, contractual obligation, or legal requirement. Some information, such as subscription purchase history but not your stored card details, may be retained as business records even after you close your account or unsubscribe from Apple Arcade. In regions such as China, that period can be 30 years.

Family Sharing

When you subscribe to Apple Arcade, the subscription is available to the other members of your Family. With Content & Privacy Restrictions in Screen Time, you can limit time spent in specific apps and block features on your child’s device. You can also restrict the settings on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple Vision Pro for explicit content, purchases and downloads, and privacy. If you do not want to share an Arcade subscription with your family members, you can disable Purchase Sharing. On your iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Family Sharing > Purchase Sharing. On Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] > Family Sharing > Purchase Sharing.

Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity

We collect personal data to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in Apple Arcade and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information (approximated by matching the IP address of your internet connection to a geographic region, if available), download and purchase history, searches, and other interactions with Apple Arcade and other apps and services.

We may also compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt to subscribe, using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
