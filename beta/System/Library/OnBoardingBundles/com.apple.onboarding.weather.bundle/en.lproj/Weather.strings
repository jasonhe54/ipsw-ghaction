"FOOTER_TEXT" = "Protecting the privacy and security of your information is a priority for everyone at Apple. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better. When we do collect data we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Weather, like every Apple product and service, is designed with these principles in mind.

To understand and improve the Weather app, Apple collects limited information about the first time you launch the app in a day. This information is not linked to your identity.

If you allow Weather to access your location, your location will be sent to Apple to provide relevant weather forecasts. If you request a forecast for a location you follow, that information will be sent to Apple to provide a forecast for that location. Additionally, Weather will access your Home and Work locations, where available, to label these locations in the app. You can use My Card in the Contacts app to update your home and work addresses. You can also turn these labels off at any time. On your iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > Apps > Weather, then tap to turn off Home and Work. On Mac, go to Weather > Settings > General and deselect Home and Work. The information Apple collects to provide forecasts is not linked to your identity.

If you choose to enable severe weather notifications, where available, Weather corresponds each location where you have enabled such notifications with a region. A region may be a country, or for some countries (such as the U.S. and Canada), a region may be an area with at least 500,000 residents. The list of regions for which you have enabled such notifications will be sent to Apple and can be associated with your Apple Account. Apple uses the list of regions to enable this feature and deliver the notifications to your device. Weather filters the regional notifications on your device based on the specific locations for which you have enabled severe weather notifications in order to deliver the relevant notifications to you.

You may also choose to enable severe weather notifications for your possible travel destinations, where available. If Significant Locations & Routes is enabled, your device may use on-device processing to predict where you may travel to in the near future. If your location permission for the Weather app is set to Always and severe weather notifications are enabled for Suggested Locations in the Weather app settings, Weather may access and use those predicted travel destinations to deliver relevant severe weather notifications to you. As with severe weather notifications for your current locations, Apple can associate the region of your possible travel destinations with your Apple Account.

You can manage notifications for the Weather app, including severe weather notifications for your current and predicted locations, on your iOS and iPadOS devices by tapping More > Notifications. On Mac, go to Weather > Settings > Notifications.

Additionally, if you use widget Smart Stacks and have enabled Widget Suggestions, the Weather app may donate a weather widget for your possible travel destinations to be displayed on your Home Screen and in Today View. This can occur when the Weather app location permission is set to Always and Significant Locations & Routes is enabled in Location Services settings. Your device determines whether to display the widget to you.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
