To start an AirDrop transfer, both the sending and receiving devices must have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned on, and they must be within close proximity of each other. When both devices are nearby and have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and AirDrop enabled, you can choose the file to share, select the recipient from a list of nearby AirDrop-enabled devices, and start the transfer. The recipient can accept or decline the transfer. If accepted, your device will encrypt and initiate the transfer over Wi-Fi.

Once a transfer is started, if the sending and receiving devices leave close proximity and are not connected to the same Wi-Fi network, the transfer may be completed using the internet. Files transferring over the internet may travel over Apple servers to the receiving device. AirDrop uses end-to-end encryption, so there’s no way for Apple to decrypt the content of the materials you transfer. Although Apple does not retain copies of your AirDrop transfers, Apple may retain limited information about your use of AirDrop in a way that doesn’t identify you, in order to improve our products, services, and technologies.
