Sign in with Apple protects your privacy by allowing you to sign in to an app (or App Clip) without having to provide the developer with information that personally identifies you. Sign in with Apple also allows you to sign in to a website without having to provide the developer with any additional information that personally identifies you beyond information used by your browser for normal web functions. Instead, when you use Sign in with Apple, Apple provides the app developer with a unique identifier, allowing you to keep your information private. This identifier is distinct for each app developer, to help prevent different developers from gathering and sharing information about you across apps. Developers can also let you use Sign in with Apple for existing accounts on their apps or websites. If a developer chooses to enable this, you can keep the account you have already but sign in to it using Sign in with Apple.

Because certain apps may have reason to collect more information about you — for example, to refer to your account by name or contact you by email — some developers may ask for your name or email address when you use Sign in with Apple. Your name will default to the name associated with your Apple Account, which you can edit before sharing with the developer. If the developer asks for an email address, you can choose to provide the developer with any of the email addresses associated with your Apple Account, or to hide your email address. If you choose to hide your email address from the developer, Apple will generate and provide the developer with a unique email address for them to use to communicate with you. Apple will forward email received at that address to an email address associated with your Apple Account; Apple deletes messages after delivery or after a short while if undeliverable. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can change the email address to which mail is forwarded, or disable email forwarding, by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud > iCloud Mail > Mail Forwarding. On your Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] > Personal Information. When you deactivate and delete an email address used with Hide My Email, it is retained in association with your Apple Account for 30 days for purposes of abuse prevention. The removed address is thereafter permanently deleted from your Apple Account, and retained only for security purposes such as to prevent reissuing the address.

If you choose to enable Sign in with Apple for an app, that choice is linked to the Apple Account you use for iCloud, so that you can easily use Sign in with Apple for that app on all of your Apple devices.

For fraud prevention and security reasons, the first time you use Sign in with Apple with a new app, Apple will share a simple binary score with the developer to give them confidence that you are a real person. This score is derived from your recent Apple account activity along with abstracted information about your device and device usage patterns. Neither Apple nor the developer receives any specific information about how you use your device.

Using Sign in with Apple

Apple knows when you enable Sign in with Apple for an app or website so that we can help set up the sign-in. When you then use Sign in with Apple with an app on your iPhone, Apple does not see or retain a history of which apps you sign in to or when you use Sign in with Apple — that information stays on your device. When you use Sign in with Apple on Safari, Apple sees when you sign in to a website so that Apple can authenticate your sign in, but Apple does not retain a history of what websites you sign in to or when you use Sign in with Apple.

Even if you use Sign in with Apple to sign in to an app or website, developers can ask you for additional personal information after sign-in. Any personal information that you choose to provide to a developer is subject to their privacy policy.

Managing Sign in with Apple

To manage Sign in with Apple, go to Settings > [your name] > Sign-In & Security > Apps Using Your Apple Account on iOS, to System Settings > [your name] > Sign-In & Security on Mac, or visit account.apple.com and go to the Sign-In and Security section, then go to Sign in with Apple. There, you can find a list of the apps using Sign in with Apple, review their privacy policy, and disable Sign in with Apple. If you choose to disable Sign in with Apple for an app, information that was shared with the developer to set up Sign in with Apple for that app and any information that the developer associated with your Sign in with Apple account will continue to be handled according to the developer’s privacy policy.
