When we do collect data we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Stocks, like every Apple product and service, is designed with these principles in mind.

To improve Stocks, we collect information about the performance of and your interaction with the app. For users in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, this includes information about how you use Apple News in Stocks. The data is associated with an identifier specific to Stocks and Apple News (where available) and is not linked to other Apple services. You can reset the identifier on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Apps > Stocks, then tapping to turn on Reset Identifier. On Mac, open Stocks, then go to Stocks > Reset Identifier and click Reset Identifier. For more details about the information we collect for Apple News, visit www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-news.

Apple News recommendations in the Stocks app are based on the Apple News articles you read in Stocks, where available. To clear data used for recommendations in the Stocks app on your iOS or iPadOS device, tap More in the upper right corner, then tap Clear Recommendations Data. In the Stocks app on your Mac, go to Stocks > Clear Recommendations Data.

Information about the news subscriptions you purchase with your Apple Account, where available in Apple News, is used to ensure you can access your subscriptions in Stocks.

In order to deliver great content, Stocks is ad-supported. If the Personalized Ads setting is turned on, Apple’s advertising platform may use your information to serve ads that are more relevant to you. Turning off Personalized Ads will prevent Apple from using this information for ad targeting. It may not decrease the number of ads you receive, but the ads may be less relevant to you. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can turn off Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising, and deselect the Personalized Ads checkbox. The stories you read and listen to in Apple News and Stocks will be used only to send advertisements to you when you are in the Apple News or Stocks apps.

Stock quotes and data (and news stories about the stocks you follow for users outside the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada) are provided by partners who are required to treat the information in line with Apple’s requirements.
