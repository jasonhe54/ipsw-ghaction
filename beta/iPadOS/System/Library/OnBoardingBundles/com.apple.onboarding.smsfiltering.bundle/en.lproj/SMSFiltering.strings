If you do, the third-party filter provider can access all of the text and content included in incoming RCS, SMS and MMS messages that you receive from unknown senders. These messages may include verification codes from banks or other institutions, as well as other personal or sensitive information that may be in RCS, SMS, and MMS messages. When you use a third-party provider’s Text Message spam filter, you are subject to the filter provider’s terms, privacy policy, and practices. We encourage you to learn about the terms, privacy policies, and practices of those third parties. To remove a third-party Text Message spam filter, go to Settings > Apps > Messages > Unknown & Spam, and remove the filter from the list.

After you have responded to a text message three times, or have added the sender to your Contacts, text messages from that sender will not be filtered as an unknown sender.
