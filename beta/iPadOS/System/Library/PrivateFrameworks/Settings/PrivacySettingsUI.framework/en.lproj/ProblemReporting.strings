With your consent, there are three types of analytics Apple may collect:  iOS device analytics, iCloud analytics and App analytics.  Your iOS device can automatically collect analytics information about your iOS device and any paired Apple Watch and send it to Apple for analysis, but only with your explicit consent.  We would also like your help to improve our products and services by using, in a privacy preserving manner, data from your iCloud account. You can also assist Apple’s partners and developers by providing aggregated information about applications and services you use by turning on App analytics.

iOS Device Analytics
%@ may include details about hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics, and data about how you use your devices and applications. None of the collected information identifies you personally. Personal data is either not logged at all, is subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy, or is removed from any reports before they’re sent to Apple. You can review this information by going to Settings on your iOS device, tapping Privacy & Security, tapping Analytics and looking under Analytics Data.

If you have consented to provide Apple with this information, and you have Location Services turned on, the location of your devices may also be sent to help Apple analyze performance issues (for example, the strength or weakness of a mobile signal in a particular location). This analytics location data may include locations such as the location of your devices once per day, the location where a call ends or the location of a failed in-store transaction. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Analytics at any time. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy & Security, tap Location Services, tap System Services and turn off the %@ switch.

You may also choose to turn off %@ altogether. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy & Security, tap Analytics, and set “%@” to off. If you have an Apple Watch paired with your iPhone, then set “Share iPhone & Watch Analytics” to off.

iCloud Analytics
Analysis of data from your iCloud account is undertaken only after the data has undergone privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy.  Analysis of such data will allow Apple to improve intelligent features and services such as Siri and other similar or related services.

You may choose to turn off iCloud Analytics at any time. To do so, you can open Settings, tap Privacy & Security, tap Analytics and set “Share iCloud Analytics” to off.

App Analytics
To help Apple’s partners and third-party developers improve their apps, products and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may provide such partners or developers with a subset of analytics information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s app, product or service, as well as statistics about how you use that partner’s or developer’s app, as long as the analytics information and statistics are aggregated or in a form that does not personally identify you.

You may choose not to share crash data and statistics about how you use apps with third-party app developers. To do so, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Privacy & Security, tap Analytics, and turn off Share With App Developers. If Analytics is set to Don’t Send, sharing crash data and statistics about how you use their apps with third-party app developers is automatically turned off.
