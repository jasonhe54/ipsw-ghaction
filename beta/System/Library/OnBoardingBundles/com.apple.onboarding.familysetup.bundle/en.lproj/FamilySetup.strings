"FOOTER_TEXT" = "Apple Watch for Your Kids allows you to pair a family member’s Apple Watch with your iPhone. Apple Watch for Your Kids requires that you and your family member are a part of the same Family Sharing, and that you are the family organizer or a parent/guardian in your family group. If you do not have Family Sharing, you will need to set it up, or if your family member does not have an Apple Account, you will need to create one.

With Apple Watch for Your Kids, certain watchOS features will be available for use even when the family member’s Apple Watch is not in proximity of your iPhone. Not all watchOS features may be available with Apple Watch for Your Kids. There may be additional watchOS features that are not available if the Apple Watch does not have a cellular plan or depending on the age of the family member, such as the ability to place calls. When you add an Apple Watch to Apple Watch for Your Kids with cellular capability, the Apple Watch serial number and cellular hardware identifiers will be sent to Apple so that the cellular plan can be configured.

For certain features, you will have the ability to request to receive certain data from your family member’s Apple Watch. This includes information such as your family member’s health, location, and contacts data. Your family member may have the ability to share or stop sharing this data with you. If you request the ability to access the health data of your family member, the member will be prompted on their Watch. If your family member chooses to share their health data with you, this information will be sent to Apple end-to-end encrypted. This data will be tied to your Apple Account solely to allow Apple to enable the sharing of this information.

With Schooltime, you have the ability to determine a window of time when use of certain features of the Apple Watch will be restricted. If your family member unlocks their Watch during Schooltime, you can view unlocks in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. This information is sent to Apple end-to-end encrypted, but will be tied to your Apple Account solely to allow Apple to provide information about unlocks.

With Apple Watch for Your Kids, you can also view logs and screenshots from your family member’s Apple Watch on your iPhone.

You can disable Apple Watch for Your Kids at any time through the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, and your family member can disable Apple Watch for Your Kids through Settings on Apple Watch. Your family member can also change their preferences, including sharing of data with you, at any time in Settings on Apple Watch.

Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this notice and in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, or as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest period permissible under law.

At all times, information collected by Apple from your use of Apple Watch for Your Kids or any of the features enabled through Apple Watch for Your Kids will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
