Connecting Your Card

When you tap on a card in Wallet, Apple will check whether it is eligible to be connected to your financial institution by looking at the country and issuer. Apple may also limit participation in the feature for performance reasons; any such limitation will be randomly distributed and will not be based on any qualities of your relationship with Apple.

When you tap to connect a card, Apple uses information about your card and underlying account (such as a partial account number) to identify the issuing financial institution. Apple uses this information to present you with the connection types available (such as the categories of financial information available) and any choices you may have, such as the duration of the connection. After you make your selection, Apple sends the financial institution information about the type of connection being set up, including the start time of the connection and the type of information being requested, such as transaction and balance data, and an account identifier. If approved, the bank sends Apple an identifier that the device can use to set up the connected card.

Your device uses the identifier and a secure link to connect to the financial institution’s app or webpage. You will authenticate with your financial institution and may identify the accounts you would like to connect to your device. Your financial institution uses information about your accounts and scope of connection to create a consent token, which can be used by your device to access your account and fetch updated data. Apple encrypts the consent token and sends it to your device for storage; Apple does not store the consent token.

Updating and Viewing Your Account Information

Your account information will be updated whenever you interact with your account by tapping the card in Wallet and your balance information will be updated when you take steps to initiate an online or in-app Apple Pay transaction with the connected card. Certain connected cards may also support the ability to automatically update your account and balance information in Wallet. You may manage your connected account settings view your updated account information at any time by going to Wallet and tapping your connected card, or by going to Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay.

Removing Your Account Information

You may stop the fetching of updated account information by going to Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > [your financial institution], and tapping to turn off Fetch Data. Once disabled, you may delete existing account information by tapping Delete Account Activity.

You may disconnect your account at any time by going to Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > tapping [your financial institution] > Disconnect. Disconnecting your financial institution will withdraw your consent for Apple to receive your account information, disconnect all accounts associated with that financial institution, and delete all account information previously fetched.

Analytics

To help improve the feature, Apple collects information about the connection process and the use of your connected cards in the Wallet and Settings apps and stores that information in a way that does not identify you personally. This information includes the time it takes to complete the connection process and which aspects of the connected card feature are most frequently used. Apple may also use this information to improve Apple products and services, for marketing, and for fraud and security purposes.

Communications

Apple may use the fact that you connected a card to determine whether a message is relevant to you, including a marketing message. Anonymous and aggregate information that cannot be tied to you may also be used to market the feature and for other messaging. You can opt out of marketing messages by clicking the unsubscribe link in a marketing email or by turning off notifications for Wallet.
