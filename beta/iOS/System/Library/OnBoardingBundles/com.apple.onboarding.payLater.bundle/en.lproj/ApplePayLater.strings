Applying for Apple Pay Later

When you apply for Apple Pay Later, your legal name, date of birth, phone number, and address are used by Apple Financing to verify your identity and help prevent fraud. Apple Financing verifies the information provided with third-party identity verification service providers, who may use the information only for fraud prevention. To help protect your identity, you may be asked to provide additional information for verification, such as uploading the front and back of your government-issued identification, providing your full SSN, or entering a verification code sent to a phone number that Apple’s identity verification service provider has linked to your legal identity. The images of your photo ID are end-to-end encrypted to a third-party identity verification service provider to verify your identity. To help verify your identity and prevent fraud, Apple Inc. also shares information about your Apple account, such as your name and email address associated with your Apple Account, with Apple Financing.

Your verified identity information will be associated with your Apple Account and stored on file with Apple Financing for use with Apple Pay Later and all Apple Financing-provided products. To update your Apple Financing account information, tap the Apple Pay Later pass in Wallet, tap the Info button in the upper-right corner, then tap Personal Information.

Your application will not be submitted to Apple Financing for a credit decision until you accept the Apple Pay Later terms and conditions and the Apple Financing Privacy Notice. After submission, Apple Financing may share your verified identity information with a nationwide consumer reporting agency to obtain your latest consumer report. Apple Financing may use your consumer report, as well as the purchase price, and certain information about your relationship with Apple to determine the terms of your offer of credit. Your consumer report and any other data material to the determination of your offer of credit, as well as the terms of your Apple Financing offer of credit, will be stored identifiably in Apple Financing to provide you with Apple Pay Later, to improve Apple Pay Later and to comply with law. Your consumer report may also be used by Apple Financing to help prevent Apple Pay Later application-related fraud. When you apply to use Apple Pay Later with a particular merchant, Apple Financing may use the name and category of that merchant, but not your shopping history, to identify and implement metrics for credit decisioning.

Improving Apple Pay Later

Certain information about your relationship with Apple will be shared with and used by Apple Financing to help identify metrics to improve Apple Financing credit decisioning. The identified metrics may be used for credit decisioning. Information shared includes information about:

• Devices that are or have been associated with your Apple Account.

• Purchases at the Apple Store, Apple.com, and via the Apple Store app, such as what was purchased, for how much, and whether and what type of financing or payment method was used. This does not include purchases that may allow Apple to infer sensitive information, such as the purchase of a glucose monitor.

• Apple Pay cards, such as whether you have attempted to add a payment card and if it was successful or unsuccessful.

• How you applied for and whether you were offered Apple Card.

• Apple Cash transactions made with Apple Payments Inc., such as whether you were sending or receiving funds, and your transaction amount. This does not include to or from whom you send or receive funds.

• App Store transactions, such as whether the purchase was a subscription, a download of a financial app, and the type of payment method used. This does not include the name or developer of your app, content purchase, or download.

Paying with Apple Pay Later

If you choose to pay with Apple Pay Later, Apple Financing, our issuing bank Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch (“Goldman Sachs”) and payment network partner (Mastercard), and our service providers receive information about your transaction, including the merchant, time, and amount in order to operate Apple Pay Later. To help protect your privacy, Apple Financing, but not Apple Inc., will have a history of where you shopped with Apple Pay Later and how much you paid. Apple Financing, Goldman Sachs, and Mastercard do not sell your Apple Pay Later transaction information to third parties for advertising or marketing.

To help prevent fraud on Apple Pay Later, Apple Financing will also use information about your transaction and the merchant with whom you’re transacting for fraud prevention. It will combine this information with information about your Apple account, such as information about the devices you’ve owned, Apple Store and App Store transactions, Apple Payments Inc. provisioning history and transactions, Apple Pay provisions, and how you applied for and whether you were offered Apple Card, as well as information about your Apple Pay Later application, verified identity, identity verification service provider responses, and transactions for fraud prevention. As with Apple Pay, your device may also evaluate device use patterns (for example, percent of time device is in motion, approximate number of calls per week) to help identify fraud. The information evaluated by your device is not shared with Apple or Apple Financing in a way that can be linked to you.

Apple Pay Later Loan Payments

Apple Pay Later loan payments must be made using an Apple Pay-eligible debit card. When setting up a payment method, Apple Wallet will check to see if you have already provisioned an eligible debit card to Apple Pay and, if so, will suggest those payment methods. If no eligible debit cards are available, you must add a new debit card to Apple Pay to make payments. The provision of a new debit card to Apple Pay is governed by the Apple Pay & Privacy notice at www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-pay. Information about the payment method you use for your Apple Pay Later loan payments, including the debit card number, date of payments, auto-pay enrollment, and similar, will be stored by Apple Financing for so long as is necessary to complete your payment, to prevent fraud, and as required by law.

Your Apple Pay Later loan status (for example, current, delinquent) will not impact your access to other Apple Inc. products and services, such as your iCloud storage or media subscriptions. However, Apple Financing will share cases of confirmed fraud with Apple Inc., which may impact your access to Apple Inc. products and services, as well as Apple Financing offerings. Apple Financing may also share information about your loan status with consumer reporting agencies.

Apple Pay Later and Analytics

To help improve Apple Pay Later, Apple Financing collects information about the Apple Pay Later application process, and the use of Apple Pay Later features in the Wallet app and stores the information in a way that does not identify you personally. This information includes the time it takes to complete the application and what Apple Pay Later features are most frequently used. Apple Financing also collects information about other interactions with Apple Pay Later, such as with Apple Pay Later Support, in a way that is linked to you. Such information may be used for internal analytics to help improve Apple Pay Later.

To help prevent bias, a group within Apple Financing uses your application information in combination with publicly available information to infer your gender and race. The group uses these inferences, along with your age and the terms of your offer of credit only to help identify bias. Results of the analysis, but not the underlying inferences or other individual-level information, are reported to others in Apple Financing to help evaluate bias and improve Apple Financing credit risking.

Apple Financing may also use identifiable information about your account with Apple, such as the fact that you have Apple Pay Later, for internal analytics purposes, such as financial forecasting.

Apple Pay Later and Communications

Apple Financing may use your Apple Pay Later account status, such as whether you have applied for or are currently using Apple Pay Later, to determine whether a message is relevant to you, including a marketing message. Limited information about your Apple account, such as how long you have had your Apple Account and whether or not you have an Apple service, may be shared by Apple Inc. with Apple Financing for marketing purposes. Apple Financing may also send messages to your device, which may use information known to you and your device and not Apple or Apple Financing to help determine whether a message is relevant to you. Apple Financing does not know which messages you see on your device.

Apple Financing may also share whether or not you have Apple Pay Later with Apple Inc. Apple Inc. will only use this information to help you discover Apple products and services.

Anonymous and aggregate information that cannot be tied to you may also be used for Apple Pay Later marketing and other messaging. You can opt out of marketing messages by clicking the unsubscribe link in a marketing email or by turning off notifications for Apple Pay Later by disabling notifications for Wallet.

Apple Pay Later Support

If you have questions about Apple Pay Later, you can contact support through your Wallet app by initiating Messages, or by contacting Apple Pay Later Support, which relies on dedicated Apple Inc. systems to help process your support request with Apple Pay Later Support. Identifiable financial information about your Apple Pay Later support request will not be stored by or otherwise shared with Apple Inc. without your consent. Apple Financing will use any information you share, including personal information, to process your request. Depending on the nature of your request — for example, in the case of disputes — Apple Financing may need to share information about your inquiry with the Apple Pay Later issuing bank, payment network partner, and the merchant for resolution.

Closing Your Apple Pay Later Account

You may close your Apple Pay Later account by contacting Apple Support. Apple Financing will continue to retain any personal data as required by law.

Apple Pay Later and Merchants

When shopping online or in-app, a merchant may check to see if your device is eligible for Apple Pay Later to show Apple Pay Later payment options. Merchants may use this to infer that you are on an operating system supporting Apple Pay Later; their handling of this information is subject to their privacy policies. You may check out with Apple Pay Later by tapping directly on an Apple Pay button on a merchant website or app. The Apple Pay button may be accompanied by more information about Apple Pay Later and your purchase, which would be provided by Apple Financing.

Eligibility

To allow you to set up Apple Pay Later, when your device updates to iOS 16 or later, your age, country, and operating system version will be sent to Apple to confirm that you are of legal age to use Apple Pay Later, in the U.S., and on an operating system that supports Apple Pay Later. Whether you are eligible for Apple Pay Later will be used to display Apple Pay Later payment options for you in the Wallet app or the Apple Pay payment sheet. If you no longer want to see Apple Pay Later payment options when using Apple Pay online or in apps, go to Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay and tap to turn off Show Apple Pay Later Option.
