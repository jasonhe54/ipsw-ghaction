These messages have a gray background to distinguish them from iMessages and standard SMS. Apple Messages for Business are encrypted between your device and Apple’s servers, and when Apple transmits them to the business. Apple doesn’t read the content of your Apple Messages for Business conversations with other businesses.

Apple can check whether your device is eligible for Apple to initiate an Apple Messages for Business conversation with you. When you chat with Apple, Apple will receive an identifier associated with your Apple Account or phone number. This information, and your conversation, may be used to support your interaction with Apple.

When you initiate a conversation with another business, they are provided a session identifier. Other businesses may also receive limited additional information. For example, if you search in Maps for a bank and start an Apple Messages for Business conversation, the business may be informed which branch you chose. This information when held by that business, as well as other information you provide to a business, is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to learn about the terms, privacy policies, and practices of businesses you chat with to understand how they use and share this information.

You may subscribe to Business Updates by providing your phone number and authorization directly to a business. Business Updates allows a business to message you with updates such as details about your purchase. If you reply to a Business Update, Apple will provide the session identifier of your Apple Messages for Business conversation to the business to improve the customer service experience. If you no longer want to receive Business Updates, you can disable them by going to Settings > Apps > Messages > Business Messages > Business Updates.

Your device will suggest which phone numbers are capable of supporting Apple Messages for Business. When a phone number is selected, your device will ask Apple servers if the number supports Apple Messages for Business using a privacy-preserving method. Your device will ask Apple servers for a block of phone numbers which may or may not contain the selected number. Your device will use the information returned by Apple servers to determine whether the numbers support Apple Messages for Business.
