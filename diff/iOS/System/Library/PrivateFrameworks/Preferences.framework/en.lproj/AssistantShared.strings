"ASSISTANT_ABOUT_TEXT" = "When you use Ask Siri and Dictation the things you say and dictate will be recorded and sent to Apple to process your requests. Your device will also send Apple other information, such as your name and nickname; the names, nicknames, and relationship with you (e.g., “my dad”) of your contacts, music you enjoy, HomeKit-enabled devices in your home (e.g., “living room lights”), the names of your photo albums, the names of Apps installed on your device (collectively, your “User Data”). All of this data is used to help Ask Siri and Dictation on your iOS device and any paired Apple Watch understand you better and recognize what you say. It is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services.

If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your device at the time you make a request will also be sent to Apple to help Ask Siri and Dictation improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Ask Siri. To do so, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Privacy & Security, tap Location Services, tap Siri & Dictation and select “Never”.

If you choose to allow third party Apps to integrate with Ask Siri, some data from these Apps may be sent to Apple to help Ask Siri understand your request, and portions of your request will be shared with the App to help provide a response or take an action (e.g., make a reservation at a restaurant or book a ride).  If you choose to allow Apps to use Ask Siri for transcription, the voice data to be transcribed may be sent to Apple.  You may control which Apps can integrate with Ask Siri at any time under Siri Settings.

You may choose to turn off Ask Siri or Dictation at any time. To turn off Ask Siri, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Siri & Search, and slide the Listen for “Hey Siri” and Press Home for Siri switches to “off”. To turn off Dictation, open Settings, tap General, tap Keyboard, and slide the Enable Dictation switch to “off”.  If you turn off both Ask Siri and Dictation, Apple will delete your User Data, as well as your recent voice input data. Older voice input data that has been disassociated from you may be retained for a period of time to generally improve Ask Siri, Dictation and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services. This voice input data may include audio files and transcripts of what you said, related diagnostic data, such as hardware and operating system specifications and performance statistics, and the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

You can also restrict the ability to use Siri & Dictation altogether under the Restrictions Setting.

By using Ask Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input, User Data, and other data that may be sent to Apple by Apps that integrate with Siri, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";

The suggestions provided by Look Up are based in part on the content of your delivered emails and messages. Look Up usage data sent to Apple is subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy.  Searches for common words and phrases will be forwarded from Apple to Microsoft’s Bing search engine. These searches are not stored by Microsoft. To provide you with more relevant music and video suggestions, if your device can access music or video subscription services, then information such as the names of the subscription services and types of subscriptions may be sent to Apple. Your account name, number and password will not be sent to Apple. Location, search queries, and usage information sent to Apple will only be used by Apple to make Spotlight Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services.

If you do not want your Spotlight and Look Up search queries and Spotlight Suggestions usage data sent to Apple, you can turn off Spotlight Suggestions. To do so, open Settings, tap General, tap Spotlight Search and deselect both Suggestions in Search and Suggestions in Look Up. If you turn off Spotlight Suggestions, Spotlight will only search the contents of your device.

To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy & Security, tap Location Services, tap System Services, and slide the Suggestions & Search switch to “off”.
