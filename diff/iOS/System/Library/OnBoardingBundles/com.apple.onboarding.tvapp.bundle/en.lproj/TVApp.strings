You can access all of this content through the Videos app across supported devices that are signed in to the same Apple Account.

Providing the Videos App

We use your personal data to provide the services and features in the Videos app. This information includes your account and payment information, which you can access and change in Settings.

Apple collects information about what you purchase and what you’re watching in the Videos app on any supported devices signed in to the same Apple Account. Apple stores this information associated with your Apple Account so we can display what you’re watching across your supported devices. When you sign in to third-party apps, information about whether you have subscribed to those services is used to display content available to you. If you grant permission for a third-party app to be connected to the Videos app, Apple will collect and store information about what you watch from that app on any of your supported devices, as well as your subscription status. Apple apps with supported content, such as Apple Music and Remote, will be automatically connected when you start using the Videos app.

Information about what you’re watching will include what content you’re playing, when you played it, the device you played it from, and where in the content you paused or stopped watching. We also collect a detailed history of all playback activity for Apple TV channels and your Apple TV subscription.

If you allow the Videos app to access your location, your location will be used to determine what’s available to browse or watch in your region, including local content like live sports, events, and news. Some content includes geographically relevant ads. Apple may separately use the IP address of your internet connection to determine the country or region from which you are accessing the service to ensure we have the necessary licensing rights for you to play the content you’ve selected. We discard the IP address, and any location information derived from the IP address, once this determination has been made.

Improving the Videos App

Apple collects information about your usage of the Videos app and your account, including the features you use (for example, Continue Watching or Library), items you search for, your interactions with notifications, content pages you browse or view, information on errors or crashes within the app, and your billing zip code. We use this information, approximate location information that does not identify you, and information about what you watch to help improve and optimize the service for you and others. We also collect information about your device such as the type of device, the channel through which your device was obtained, the version of your operating system, and the amount of free space on your device. We may use this information to assess whether requested content can be downloaded, to understand general trends in device usage and storage, and whether your device is connected by WLAN or cellular. For example, knowing the free space on your device allowed us to build the feature that lets you buy a movie on your iPhone without downloading it at purchase. If you use SharePlay to watch content with other users, the Videos app will collect that you watched that content during a SharePlay session and the number of devices that participated in the session, but does not collect any information to identify the participants of a SharePlay session.

We use Videos search data to improve models that power Videos. For example, aggregate Videos search queries are used to fine-tune the Videos search model.  

Personalizing the Videos App

We personalize the Videos app to help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we recommend movies that we think will be of interest to you based on movies you’ve previously watched, and we provide more relevant search results to you based on your activity in the Videos app. To provide personalization, we use information including what you watch, your purchases, subscriptions, downloads, searches, browsing, and other activities in the Videos app, as well as information from your account such as your age.

If you do not want Apple to use information about what you watch on this device in the Videos app for personalization on all devices that support the Videos app, you can turn off Use Play History in Settings. On your iOS, iPadOS, visionOS, or tvOS device, go to Settings > Apps > Videos > Use Play History. In the Videos app on Mac, go to Videos > Settings > Playback, then deselect Use Viewing History.

You can turn off personalization features in the App Store, Apple Books, the iTunes Store, Videos, Apple Podcasts, and for subscriptions from Apple by turning off Personalized Recommendations for your Apple Account. On your iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Media & Purchases > View Account, and then tap to turn off Personalized Recommendations.

Communicating with You

Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own, your subscriptions to Apple services, the Apple apps you download, and your billing zip code, to send you communications about the Videos app and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, including Apple One. Details about your device, such as its device serial number, or details about your relevant App Store subscriptions may be used to check eligibility for Apple offers. If you are in a Family Sharing group, Apple may send you communications about products, services, and offers available to you through Family Sharing. If you purchase an Apple One subscription, we may send you emails and notifications about the features of each of the services for which you have subscribed. Apple may also use information about your activity within the Videos app to send you emails and notifications about new features, content, and offers available in the Videos app. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to account.apple.com. To update notification preferences on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Notifications > Videos.

Advertising

In the Videos app, if you allow the Videos app to access your location, your location may be used to serve geographically relevant ads.

In other apps such as the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks, if the Personalized Ads setting is turned on, Apple’s advertising platform may use your information, including information about the movies and TV shows you purchase from Apple, to serve ads in the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks that are more relevant to you.

If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can choose to turn off Personalized Ads. Turning off Personalized Ads will prevent Apple from using your information for ad targeting. It may not decrease the number of ads you receive, but the ads may be less relevant to you.

You can change your Personalized Ads settings by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising.

Learn more about Apple Advertising & Privacy at www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-advertising.

Learn about how to opt out of personalized ads on the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks at support.apple.com/105131.

Apple TV Subscriptions Through Partners

If your mobile network provider offers Apple TV subscriptions and free trials, Apple may check your phone number to determine whether you are eligible through a mobile network provider partner. If you sign up for an Apple TV subscription or free trial through your mobile network provider or another Apple partner, Apple will use your phone number or a unique account identifier shared by the partner to identify your account and to let the mobile network provider or other partner know that you have activated your subscription. We will use the phone number or unique identifier associated with your subscription to verify your account at sign in and to connect your Apple TV subscription with your account.

If you purchase an Apple TV subscription through a partner that enables you to watch Apple TV subscription content on their platform, the partner may allow you to connect your partner account and your Apple Account so that you can also view Apple TV subscription content in the Videos app. When you choose to connect your partner account, Apple receives certain information about your account with partner, but Apple stores only your Apple TV subscription status along with a partner ID.

Sharing with Third Parties

We provide some non-personal data to our advertisers and strategic partners that work with Apple to provide our products and services, help Apple market to customers, and sell ads on Apple’s behalf to display on the App Store and Apple News and Stocks. For example, we may share non-personal data about your transactions, viewing activity, and region, as well as aggregated user demographics such as age group and gender (which may be inferred from information such as your name and salutation in your Apple Account), to Videos strategic partners, such as content owners, so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their associated products and services.

If you sign in to the Videos app on a non-Apple device, Apple may share information with the platform provider to enable the app to function, so that the content from your Videos subscriptions appears on the platform, and to support platform features such as providing search results and personalized recommendations. This may include information about whether you have opened the Videos app and, where available, whether you have subscribed to Apple TV and Apple TV channels. You can choose to stop sharing your subscription information in the Videos app settings on your non-Apple device, although doing so may limit the ways that content appears on the platform.

On supported non-Apple devices, you can choose whether to share what you watch, buy, or rent in the Videos app, including your Apple TV subscription, Apple TV channels, and other content (where available) with the provider of your third-party platform. This may include your profile name or other information used to match your data from the Videos app with your account or profile on your non-Apple device. Your platform provider may use your information from the Videos app to enable platform features such as displaying the shows you have in progress and personalized recommendations. You can turn this off by going to the Videos app settings on your non-Apple device. On some devices, this may direct you to the platform’s settings.

If you choose to sign in to the Videos app on a non-Apple device, you should review the terms, privacy policies, and practices of the platform’s provider to understand what data it collects, uses, and shares.

Retention

We retain personal data associated with your purchases, downloads, and viewing activity on the Videos app for different lengths of time depending on business need, contractual obligations, and legal requirements. For purchases and downloads, that often requires at least a 10-year retention period, but in regions such as China that period can be 30 years. We also retain a record of your purchase and downloads of content for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to download that content in line with our applicable terms. We retain other information such as browsing activity and searches for up to two years. Some information, such as transactions but not your stored card details may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the Videos app.

When you use a payment card, Apple may retain and automatically update your card number and billing information for future purchases, recurring transactions, or other uses you authorize. Apple may obtain this information from your financial institution or payment network, and also use it for fraud prevention and verification.

Clear Play History

You can clear your play history in the Videos app in Settings. In the Videos app on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Account > Clear Play History. On tvOS, go to Settings > Apps > Videos > Clear Play History. This will remove all TV shows and movies from your Watchlist and disassociate any past playback history from your account. This will apply to your play data that is held and used by Apple on devices that use the same Apple Account. If you use a non-Apple device and have chosen to share what you watch with that platform’s provider, clearing your play history will not affect the play data that is stored by the platform’s provider. You should review the terms, privacy policies, and practices of the platform’s provider to understand whether you can delete the data stored by that provider.

You can remove individual items from your Watchlist by long-pressing the episode and selecting Remove from Watchlist. In the same menu, if you select Remove from Recently Watched, that will also remove the episode from being used to generate personalized recommendations. However, Apple will retain records of play history from Apple TV channels and your Apple TV subscription for reporting and royalty requirements.

Third-Party Connected Apps

You must grant permission for your participating third-party apps to be connected to the Videos app to begin sharing what you watch from those apps with Apple. When you set up the Videos app, you may be asked to grant permission for multiple applications at one time. Some of the apps may be apps that you do not yet have installed on that device, and your preferences will be applied if they are installed later. Whether or not you grant permission, you will be able to change your preferences for each app in Settings.

If at any time you decide you no longer want one of your third-party apps to be connected to the Videos app, you may disconnect that app from the Videos app and Apple will stop collecting your play data from that third-party app. In the Videos app on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Account > Connected Apps, select the third-party app and turn it off. On tvOS, go to Settings > Apps > Videos > Connect to Videos, select the third-party app and turn it off. When removing a third-party app from the Videos app, you may also choose to delete all play data information Apple has collected about content you’ve watched from that app by choosing the Remove and Clear Play History option. At any time, you may also choose to delete all of your play data information Apple has collected about all third-party content you watch in the Videos app by clearing your play history as described above. Clearing your play history in any of these described instances only clears your third-party app play data that is held and used by Apple for the Videos app. It does not affect any play data that is held separately by the third-party app provider (for example, within their own app or on their servers).

You should also review the terms, privacy policies, and practices of your participating third-party apps to understand how they use and share your play data and related information.

Videos App Profiles on tvOS and Third-Party TVs

You can create profiles, including kid profiles, associated with your Apple Account on tvOS and on the Videos app on certain third-party TVs. These profiles can be used on the Videos app on those platforms and allow for personalized experiences on the Videos app. The Apple Account with which the profiles are associated is the managing profile. To create a profile associated with your Apple Account, you must be at least 18 years old. You’ll choose a name and image for the profile, and designate whether the profile is for a kid. During profile setup, and at any time in Settings, you can control a profile’s ability to purchase and rent using your Apple Account. You can also set up content restrictions for the Videos app. On tvOS, go to Settings > Apps > Videos > Content Restrictions, select the profile, and follow the steps.

Subject to the content ratings that you choose, the profile can access and watch the content you have purchased or rented from Apple and your Apple TV subscription and Apple TV channels. The profile can also access your connected third-party video apps, but content restrictions apply only to the Videos app.

The information that Apple collects and stores about profiles is associated with the managing profile’s Apple Account. This includes, for example, detailed playback activity about what a profile watches, when it was watched, on what device, and the profile’s progress within content.

A profile can be upgraded to an Apple Account in Settings with approval from the managing profile. On tvOS, go to Settings > Profiles and Accounts, select the profile, select Upgrade to Apple Account, and follow the steps. When a profile is upgraded, information about what that profile watched, and the details associated with the watch history, will be transferred to the new Apple Account, and will no longer be associated with the managing profile. However, when a profile is upgraded, purchases, subscriptions, and rentals will remain associated with the managing profile and will not be transferred to or associated with the profile’s new Apple Account. A profile can also be deleted at any time by the managing profile in Settings. On tvOS, go to Settings > Profiles and Accounts, select the profile, and select Delete Profile. Once deleted, the profile and its watch history will no longer be available to the managing profile’s Apple Account.

Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity

We also collect personal data to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Videos app. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information (approximated by matching the IP address of your internet connection to a geographic region, if available), download and purchase history, and other interactions with the Videos app. When your subscription is set to auto-renew, Apple may also use information about your historical business relationship with Apple to process the request and determine whether to provide ongoing access to your subscription in advance of authorization by the payment partner.

We also may compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt a purchase, using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers.

Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

We process your personal data in the Videos app generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service, and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable local law.

Where applicable local law provides, we process personal data as necessary for purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party in order to:

• Display, and allow playback of, content that is available and relevant to you, including from third-party services
• Check eligibility for offers, help to improve and optimize the service for you and others, and send you communications about the Videos app and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you

We use Apple TV search data to improve models that power Apple TV. For example, aggregate Apple TV search queries are used to fine-tune the Apple TV search model.

Personalizing the Apple TV App

We personalize the Apple TV app to help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we recommend movies that we think will be of interest to you based on movies you’ve previously watched, and we provide more relevant search results to you based on your activity in the Apple TV app. To provide personalization, we use information including what you watch, your purchases, subscriptions, downloads, searches, browsing, and other activities in the Apple TV app, as well as information from your account such as your age.

If you do not want Apple to use information about what you watch on this device in the Apple TV app for personalization on all devices that support the Apple TV app, you can turn off Use Play History in Settings. On your iOS, iPadOS, visionOS, or tvOS device, go to Settings > Apps > TV > Use Play History. In the Apple TV app on Mac, go to TV > Settings > Playback, then deselect Use Viewing History.

You can turn off personalization features in the App Store, Apple Books, the iTunes Store, Apple TV, Apple Podcasts, and for subscriptions from Apple by turning off Personalized Recommendations for your Apple Account. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Media & Purchases > View Account, then tap to turn off Personalized Recommendations.

Communicating with You

Apple may use information about your account, such as the Apple products you own, your subscriptions to Apple services, the Apple apps you download, and your billing zip code, to send you communications about the Apple TV app and other Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, including Apple One. Details about your device, such as its device serial number, or details about your relevant App Store subscriptions may be used to check eligibility for Apple offers. If you are in a Family Sharing group, Apple may send you communications about products, services, and offers available to you through Family Sharing. If you purchase an Apple One subscription, we may send you emails and notifications about the features of each of the services for which you have subscribed. Apple may also use information about your activity within the Apple TV app to send you emails and notifications about new features, content, and offers available in the Apple TV app. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving these emails by going to account.apple.com.

Advertising

In the Apple TV app, if you allow the Apple TV app to access your location, your location may be used to serve geographically relevant ads.

For other apps such as the App Store, Apple News, and Stocks, if the Personalized Ads setting is turned on, Apple’s advertising platform may use your information, including information about the movies and TV shows you purchase from Apple, to serve ads in those apps that are more relevant to you.

If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can choose to turn off Personalized Ads. Turning off Personalized Ads will prevent Apple from using your information for ad targeting. It may not decrease the number of ads you receive, but the ads may be less relevant to you.

You can change your Personalized Ads settings by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising.

Apple TV Subscriptions Through Partners

If your mobile network provider offers Apple TV subscriptions and free trials, Apple may check your phone number to determine whether you are eligible through a mobile network provider partner. If you sign up for an Apple TV subscription or free trial through your mobile network provider or another Apple partner, Apple will use your phone number or a unique account identifier shared by the partner to identify your account and to let the mobile network provider or other partner know that you have activated your subscription. We will use the phone number or unique identifier associated with your subscription to verify your account at sign in and to connect your Apple TV subscription with your account.

If you purchase an Apple TV subscription through a partner that enables you to watch Apple TV subscription content on their platform, the partner may allow you to connect your partner account and your Apple Account so that you can also view Apple TV subscription content in the Apple TV app. When you choose to connect your partner account, Apple receives certain information about your account with partner, but Apple stores only your Apple TV subscription status along with a partner ID.

Sharing with Third Parties

We provide some non-personal data to our advertisers and strategic partners that work with Apple to provide our products and services, help Apple market to customers, and sell ads on Apple’s behalf to display on the App Store and Apple News and Stocks. For example, we may share non-personal data about your transactions, viewing activity, and region, as well as aggregated user demographics such as age group and gender (which may be inferred from information such as your name and salutation in your Apple Account), to Apple TV strategic partners, such as content owners, so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their associated products and services.

If you sign in to the Apple TV app on a non-Apple device, Apple may share information with the platform provider to enable the app to function, so that content from your Apple TV subscriptions appears on the platform, and to support platform features such as providing search results and personalized recommendations. This may include information about whether you have opened the Apple TV app and, where available, whether you have subscribed to Apple TV and Apple TV channels. You can choose to stop sharing your subscription information in the Apple TV app settings on your non-Apple device, although doing so may limit the ways that Apple TV content appears on the platform.

On supported non-Apple devices, you can choose whether to share what you watch, buy, or rent in the Apple TV app, including your Apple TV subscription, Apple TV channels, and other content (where available) with the provider of your third-party platform. This may include your profile name or other information used to match your data from the Apple TV app with your account or profile on your non-Apple device. Your platform provider may use your information from the Apple TV app to enable platform features such as displaying the shows you have in progress and personalized recommendations. You can turn this off by going to the Apple TV app settings on your non-Apple device. On some devices, this may direct you to the platform’s settings.

If you choose to sign in to the Apple TV app on a non-Apple device, you should review the terms, privacy policies, and practices of the platform’s provider to understand what data it collects, uses, and shares.

Retention

We retain personal data associated with your purchases, downloads, and viewing activity on the Apple TV app for different lengths of time depending on business need, contractual obligations, and legal requirements. For purchases and downloads, that often requires at least a 10-year retention period, but in regions such as China that period can be 30 years. We also retain a record of your purchase and downloads of content for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to download that content in line with our applicable terms. We retain other information such as browsing activity and searches for up to two years. Some information, such as transactions but not your stored card details may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the Apple TV app.

When you use a payment card, Apple may retain and automatically update your card number and billing information for future purchases, recurring transactions, or other uses you authorize. Apple may obtain this information from your financial institution or payment network, and also use it for fraud prevention and verification.

Clear Play History

You can clear your play history in the Apple TV app in Settings. In the Apple TV app on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Account > Clear Play History.

In the same menu, if you select Remove from Recently Watched, that will also remove the episode from being used to generate personalized recommendations. However, Apple will retain records of play history from Apple TV channels and your Apple TV subscription for reporting and royalty requirements.

Third-Party Connected Apps

You must grant permission for your participating third-party apps to be connected to the Apple TV app to begin sharing what you watch from those apps with Apple. When you set up the Apple TV app, you may be asked to grant permission for multiple applications at one time. Some of the apps may be apps that you do not yet have installed on that device, and your preferences will be applied if they are installed later. Whether or not you grant permission, you will be able to change your preferences for each app in Settings.

If at any time you decide you no longer want one of your third-party apps to be connected to the Apple TV app, you may disconnect that app from the Apple TV app and Apple will stop collecting your play data from that third-party app. In the Apple TV app on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Account > Connected Apps, select the third-party app and turn it off. On tvOS, go to Settings > Apps > TV > Connect to TV, select the third-party app and turn it off. When removing a third-party app from the Apple TV app, you may also choose to delete all play data information Apple has collected about content you’ve watched from that app by choosing the Remove and Clear Play History option. At any time, you may also choose to delete all of your play data information Apple has collected about all third-party content you watch in the Apple TV app by clearing your play history as described above. Clearing your play history in any of these described instances only clears your third-party app play data that is held and used by Apple for the Apple TV app. It does not affect any play data that is held separately by the third-party app provider (for example, within their own app or on their servers).

You should also review the terms, privacy policies, and practices of your participating third-party apps to understand how they use and share your play data and related information.

Group Recommendations

If you choose to enable Group Recommendations on an Apple TV device, information about what you watch will be used to make group recommendations with any combination of opted-in users on the same Apple TV. If a child account is in the group, recommendations for children will be included, but their watch history will not be used. You can turn off Group Recommendations for your account at any time by going to Settings > Users and Accounts, selecting your profile, then selecting For All of You.

Apple TV App Profiles on tvOS and Third-Party TVs

You can create profiles, including kid profiles, associated with your Apple Account on tvOS and on the Apple TV app on certain third-party TVs. These profiles can be used on the Apple TV app on those platforms and allow for personalized experiences on the Apple TV app. The Apple Account with which the profiles are associated is the managing profile. To create a profile associated with your Apple Account, you must be at least 18 years old. You’ll choose a name and image for the profile, and designate whether the profile is for a kid. During profile setup, and at any time in Settings, you can control a profile’s ability to purchase and rent using your Apple Account. You can also set up content restrictions for the Apple TV app. On tvOS, go to Settings > Apps > TV > Content Restrictions, select the profile, and follow the steps.

Subject to the content ratings that you choose, the profile can access and watch the content you have purchased or rented from Apple and your Apple TV subscription and Apple TV channels. The profile can also access your connected third-party video apps, but content restrictions apply only to the Apple TV app.

The information that Apple collects and stores about profiles is associated with the managing profile’s Apple Account. This includes, for example, detailed playback activity about what a profile watches, when it was watched, on what device, and the profile’s progress within content.

A profile can be upgraded to an Apple Account in Settings with approval from the managing profile. On tvOS, go to Settings > Profiles and Accounts, select the profile, select Upgrade to Apple Account, and follow the steps. When a profile is upgraded, information about what that profile watched, and the details associated with the watch history, will be transferred to the new Apple Account, and will no longer be associated with the managing profile. However, when a profile is upgraded, purchases, subscriptions, and rentals will remain associated with the managing profile and will not be transferred to or associated with the profile’s new Apple Account. A profile can also be deleted at any time by the managing profile in Settings. On tvOS, go to Settings > Profiles and Accounts, select the profile, and select Delete Profile. Once deleted, the profile and its watch history will no longer be available to the managing profile’s Apple Account.

Preventing Fraud and Other Malicious Activity

We also collect personal data to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Apple TV app. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information (approximated by matching the IP address of your internet connection to a geographic region, if available), download and purchase history, and other interactions with the Apple TV app. When your subscription is set to auto-renew, Apple may also use information about your historical business relationship with Apple to process the request and determine whether to provide ongoing access to your subscription in advance of authorization by the payment partner.

We also may compute a device trust score on your device when you attempt a purchase, using information about how you use your device, including the approximate number of phone calls or emails you send and receive. The submission is designed so Apple cannot learn the underlying values on your device. The score is stored for a fixed time on our servers.
