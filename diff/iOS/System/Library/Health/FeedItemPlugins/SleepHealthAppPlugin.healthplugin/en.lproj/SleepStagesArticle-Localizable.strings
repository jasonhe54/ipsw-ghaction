Most people will cycle through the different stages several times during a sleep session. While scientists and doctors can recognize which stage you’re in, they’re still working to fully understand the impact each stage has on the body.";

"DEEP_PARAGRAPH" = "Also known as slow wave sleep because of the brain wave patterns, this is the stage where body tissues are repaired and essential hormones are released. This stage typically happens in longer periods during the first half of your sleep session. During deep sleep, the body is so relaxed that it can be more difficult to wake up from this stage than others.";

By tracking your sleep stages and paying attention to how you feel each morning, you may gain insight into your own sleep.";
