If your school or company (“organization”) enables Sign in with Apple at Work & School, you can use your Managed Apple Account to sign in to third-party apps (including App Clips) and websites allowed by your organization. When you sign in to an allowed app or website for the first time, Apple provides the third-party app or website developers with your name, email address (if provided by your organization), and a unique user identifier that is distinct for each developer. Developers use this information to authenticate you, display your name within their interface, and assign appropriate permissions and access. Website developers will also receive information used by your browser for normal web functions.

Developers can let your organization use Sign in with Apple at Work & School for existing accounts on their apps or websites. If a developer chooses to enable this, you can use Sign in with Apple at Work & School to sign in to an account you have already.

Using Sign in with Apple at Work & School
