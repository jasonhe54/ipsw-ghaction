When you ovulate, there is often a shift in body temperature called a biphasic shift. If you wear your Apple Watch to sleep each night with Sleep Focus turned on, your wrist temperature can be measured and ovulation estimates should be available after about two cycles.

In some cases, you may not receive an ovulation estimate. There may not be enough wrist temperature measurements available, environmental factors may interfere with accurate measurements, or you may have ovulated without a biphasic shift.

Also, ovulation does not occur during every cycle, particularly if you’re pregnant, lactating, or taking hormonal birth control. A non-ovulatory cycle can also occur without the presence of any of these cycle factors.

A progesterone test can detect whether or not ovulation has occurred. Ovulation estimates are just that—estimates—and do not guarantee ovulation has happened.";
