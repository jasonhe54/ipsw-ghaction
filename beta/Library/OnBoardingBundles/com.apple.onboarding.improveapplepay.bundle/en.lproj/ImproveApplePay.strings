"FOOTER_TEXT" = "If you opt in to Improve Apple Pay, the transaction and account details listed below from cards that you have connected to your financial account and Apple-branded cards in Wallet may be used by Apple to help develop and improve Apple Pay and related features. For example, Apple may review the merchant name and category to help assess whether merchants are being appropriately categorized in a way that is useful to Apple customers.

Transaction and account details are sent directly from your device to Apple. No Apple account identifier is sent along with the information. Apple has also put in place additional guardrails to help ensure that the transaction and account details themselves cannot be used to identify you. For example, Apple does not retain the precise time at which a transaction occurs, so that precise time cannot be used to trace back to an identifiable real-world transaction. And, tools are used to help ensure that any other identifiers (for example, email, phone) added by merchants or financial institutions are removed from transaction details.

The following details are shared with and stored by Apple:

• Random identifier
• Encoded identifiers (for example, encoded transaction number)
• Transaction type (for example, debit or credit, transfer)
• Transaction amount and currency
• Transaction date
• Transaction description
• Transaction and/or account status
• Information about the merchant (for example, name, category)
• Account type and status
• Account balance
• Account terms (for example, interest rate)
• Financial institution

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
