Individuals with healthy hearing can hear very soft sounds close to 0 decibels. As people lose their hearing ability, often as they age, sounds have to be louder to be heard. In the test results, the decibels for each frequency can range from -10 (excellent hearing) to over 85 (profound hearing loss).
The average hearing for your left and right ear is based on the four frequencies that are most important for speech (500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz).";
