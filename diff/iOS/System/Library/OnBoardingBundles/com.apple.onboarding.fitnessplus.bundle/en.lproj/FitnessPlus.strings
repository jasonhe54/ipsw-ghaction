When you do these pre-subscription workouts and meditations, Apple collects information about the the titles and trainers of the workouts and meditations, the number you do, and whether you sign-up for an Apple Fitness+ subscription. We collect this information in order to understand the content that users are interested in and to optimize and improve Apple Fitness+.

Apple stores this information in aggregate not associated with your Apple Account.

Apple Fitness+ Activity and Workouts

Once you subscribe to Apple Fitness+, Apple may collect information about your browsing activity in Fitness+ in the Fitness, Workout, and Mindfulness apps, such as the pages you view, the features with which you interact, and actions that cause you to enter and exit the app such as following an external link that leads you to Fitness+ or exiting the app through a link to Apple Music. Apple also collects information about the type of device you are using, your interactions with notifications, and your subscription, as well as some demographic information including your gender and age range.
