"FOOTER_TEXT" = "If you opt in to Improve Assistive Voice Features, Apple will collect the audio and transcripts of your interactions with assistive voice features such as Vocal Shortcuts and Voice Control. Apple will collect additional information, such as whether you are using an iPhone or AirPods for audio input, the features you are using, and device and operating system specifications.

The data collected is associated with random, rotating device-generated identifiers and is not tied to your Apple Account. A subset of your interactions may be reviewed by graders to analyze and improve the accuracy and performance of assistive voice features. Only Apple employees, subject to strict confidentiality obligations, are able to access audio interactions.

Apple will use the information collected to develop and improve Vocal Shortcuts, Voice Control, and similar accessibility features, as well as to improve accessibility across other Apple features, such as Siri. Your interactions may be retained and used for up to two years. A subset of interaction data that has been graded may be kept beyond two years for ongoing improvement of these products and features.

You can change your setting for Improve Assistive Voice Features at any time. To do so on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, and tap to turn off Improve Assistive Voice Features. On Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, and click to turn off Improve Assistive Voice Features.";
