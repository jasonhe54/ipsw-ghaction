Using Tap to Pay on iPhone

When using Tap to Pay on iPhone, Apple processes your data in accordance with our agreements with you and your payment service provider, and as required by law. When initiating Tap to Pay on iPhone and opening a virtual payment terminal, Apple collects data necessary to open a valid session, such as a token that includes the identity of your payment services provider and merchant, information about the merchant like business name, and identifiers for your virtual payment terminal. Apple also collects a token indicating that your hardware is secure. If validated, Apple sends back a valid session token to your device, which your device will use to execute the transaction. To execute a transaction, your device will send encrypted transaction information to Apple; Apple does not decrypt this transaction information. Apple authenticates the transaction using information about the session token, device, and merchant, but not the content of the encrypted transaction. If authenticated, Apple helps further protect the transaction by changing the encryption key to a key that only your payment services partner can decrypt. Apple collects and maintains information about Tap to Pay on iPhone transactions, such as transaction amount, for 25 days as required for compliance with payment card industry and similar requirements.
