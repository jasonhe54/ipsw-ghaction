Providing and Improving My Sports

If you turn on syncing for My Sports, the teams and other sports interests you follow in supported apps, including Apple Sports, Apple TV, and Apple News, will automatically be followed in other supported apps. Apple collects information about your usage of My Sports, including, where available, the sports, leagues, teams, and athletes that you follow and the notifications you interact with, and stores that information associated with your Apple Account. Apple uses this information to sync your sports interests across supported Apple apps, including Apple Sports, Apple TV, and Apple News, and to personalize your experience in those apps and associated services like Apple News email newsletters. Apple also uses this information, along with information about errors and crashes, to improve My Sports and the supported Apple apps and services.

My Sports syncing allows you to have one sports experience across supported Apple apps, with content about your sports interests like articles and events appearing in supported Apple apps and associated services, including Apple Sports, Apple TV, and Apple News. You can choose to stop using My Sports to sync your sports interests at any time in the settings of supported apps. Turning off syncing for My Sports may limit the sports features available in some apps.
