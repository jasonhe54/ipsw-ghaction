• Your contact information, like your name and phone number, and the contact information of others in the conversation
• The images or videos that you are reporting
• The content contained in some limited messages before and after the images or videos you are reporting, and associated metadata, such as timestamps and sender information
• Any additional comments that you choose to provide in the report

The report is created and encrypted on your device before being securely sent to Apple. Access to the report is tightly controlled and available only to a team of trained professionals who review each report and, if necessary, share the report with law enforcement or as required by law.

Applicable Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

We process your personal data generally for performance of your contract with Apple, as necessary for providing the service, and to comply with our legal obligations. Where consent is the appropriate legal basis, we seek it in accordance with applicable law.

Retention

Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We retain reports submitted to Apple for two years as required by law. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest legal period permissible under law.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
