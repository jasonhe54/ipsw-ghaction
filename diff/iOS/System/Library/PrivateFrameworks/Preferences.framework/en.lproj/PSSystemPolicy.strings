"TRACKING_ABOUT_TEXT_REASON_UNENFORCED" = "Apple requires app developers to ask for permission before they track your activity across apps or websites they don’t own in order to target advertising to you, measure your actions due to advertising, or to share your information with data brokers. However, in your location Apple is restricted by law from enforcing this requirement. Developers may choose to, but are not required to, ask for your permission, and apps that don’t ask permission may still track you.

If a developer chooses to ask, and if you give permission for your activity to be tracked, the app can allow information about you or your device collected through the app (for example, a user or device ID, your device’s current Advertising Identifier, your name, email address, or other identifying data provided by you) to be combined with information about you or your device collected by third parties or on third party apps, sites or properties. The combined information can be used for purposes of targeted advertising or advertising measurement. The app developer may also choose to share the information with data brokers, which may result in the linking of publicly available and other information about you or your device.

When you decline to give permission for the app to track your activity, the app is prevented from accessing your device’s Advertising Identifier (previously controlled through the Limit Ad Tracking setting on your device). App developers are responsible for ensuring they comply with your choices.

It is not considered tracking when the app developer combines information about you or your device for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes if the developer is doing so solely on your device and not sending the information off your device in a way that identifies you. In addition, it is not considered tracking when the app developer shares information about you or your device with data brokers solely for fraud detection or prevention or security purposes. Finally, it is not considered tracking when the data broker with which the app developer shares information about you or your device is a consumer reporting agency and the information is shared for purposes of reporting on your credit activity (for example, that you made a payment on time) or to obtain information on your creditworthiness in order to determine your eligibility for credit.

You can control whether apps can ask for permission to track your activity, including by accessing your device’s Advertising Identifier. If you don’t want to be asked for your permission, or do not want apps to access your device’s Advertising Identifier, you can disable Allow Apps to Request to Track. On iOS and iPadOS, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking. On tvOS, go to Settings > General > Privacy > Tracking. When you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, any app that attempts to ask for your permission will be blocked from asking and automatically informed that you have requested not to be tracked. In addition, all apps, other than those that you have previously given permission to track, will be blocked from accessing the device’s Advertising Identifier. For apps you previously gave permission to track, you can tell those apps to stop tracking your activity at the same time you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track.

You can also control the tracking permission on a per-app basis for those apps that have requested permission to track your activity. On iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings, tap an app, then tap to turn off Allow Tracking, or go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking and tap to turn on or off each app displayed in the list of apps that have requested permission to track your activity. On tvOS, go to Settings > General > Privacy > Tracking and select the app in the list below Tracking.
