Adding Your Identity Card

Adding Your State Identity Card Through Wallet
To add an identity card, you will be asked to take a picture of the front and back of your government ID card, such as your driver’s license or state ID. Your device will evaluate the quality and type of the images to help ensure that the images you provide will be accepted by your government issuing authority. Your identity card images are encrypted on device and sent to your government issuing authority, which may share them with their third-party identity verification service provider; Apple does not see or store images of your identity card. Your device will read the barcode from your identity card and share name, address, and date of birth with Apple for identity verification and fraud prevention. Apple may continue to store information about the verification outcome, such as whether the identity information was successfully verified, to help support the feature and prevent fraud on underlying Apple platforms, but will not store the underlying identity information (such as the date of birth read from your barcode).

To help ensure that the person adding the identity card to Wallet is the same person to whom the identity card belongs, you will be asked to take a Live Photo of yourself. Your device will evaluate the quality of a still frame from the Live Photo you are providing in order to help ensure that the still frame photo you provide will be accepted by your government issuing authority. This still frame from your Live Photo will be encrypted on device and sent to your government issuing authority to be compared against their image on file for the ID. Your government issuing authority will process this still frame photo in accordance with their privacy policies, which may allow them to use facial recognition technology. To help prevent fraud, before your still frame photo is submitted to your government issuing authority, your Live Photo will be evaluated by your device and Apple to help ensure that the Live Photo is of a live person, and that the same live person is submitting their still frame photo as a part of adding their identity card to Wallet. You may be prompted to also conduct a series of facial and head movements, which will be evaluated in the same way as your Live Photo by your device and Apple. Information about your Live Photo, or if applicable your movements, and not the Live Photo or recording of movements themselves, is stored in a way that is associated with you while you are in the process of adding your ID.

Information about your Apple Account, device use patterns and settings, device location at the time you attempt to add your state identity card (if you have Location Services enabled), and information about your Live Photo, or facial and head movements, will be shared with Apple for fraud prevention. Apple will share fraud indicators based on this information with your government issuing authority for fraud prevention. Your government issuing authority, and not Apple, will decide whether to authorize adding your identity card to Wallet. In some cases, your government issuing authority may ask for more information or an in-person visit. Apple may receive information about the fact that your government issuing authority required additional verification and the type of verification (such as an in-person visit); Apple retains this information in a manner that is linked to you only while the government issuing authority is in the process of making a decision on whether to authorize adding your ID to Wallet for managing and improving the feature. In some cases, your government issuing authority may provide you with a verification code following their review of additional information. This verification code is encrypted on device and sent to the government issuing authority; Apple does not see or store the verification code. Your government issuing authority may provide Apple with information on the status of its authorization (for example, under review, accepted) so that Apple may send updates to your device and help manage your identity card in Wallet.

Adding Your Digital ID Card Through Wallet
This feature is available only in the United States.

To add your Digital ID, you will be asked to scan the machine-readable zone (MRZ) text on your passport’s photo page using your iPhone in order to allow your device to access the e-passport chip within your passport. You will then need to place your iPhone on your passport, as instructed by your device, to read the e-passport. Your device will send the MRZ and e-passport data to Apple to validate the information contained in the e-passport. Apple will encode and store a portion of your passport information to provide and help manage your Digital ID on your device, as well as to prevent fraud. To help ensure that the person adding the Digital ID Card to Wallet is the same person to whom the passport belongs, you will be required to take a Live Photo of yourself, the same as described above for state identity cards. For Digital ID, this information will be sent only to Apple as the issuing authority for Digital IDs, and not to your state or national government. Apple will collect and use information about your Live Photo, your Apple Account, device use patterns and settings, and device location at the time you attempt to add your Digital ID Card (if you have Location Services enabled), to determine whether to issue your Digital ID, and for fraud prevention purposes. Information about your Live Photo, and not the Live Photo itself, is stored in a way associated with you while you are in the process of adding your ID. If you choose to allow Apple to manually review your Live Photo, the Live Photo may be stored for a short period of time by Apple, as described in the Improving Identity Cards section below.

Adding Your Identity Card Through the Issuing Authority’s App
This feature is available only in Japan.

To add an identity card to Wallet through a government issuing authority’s app, you will need to agree to the issuing authority’s terms and conditions, and may need to complete steps to prove your identity to the government issuing authority, as well as setting up a PIN or password for your identity card. Your PIN or password can be updated only through the government issuing authority’s app. Apple does not receive any information about your activity in the government issuing authority’s app. Your government issuing authority, and not Apple, will decide whether to authorize adding your identity card to Wallet.

Provisioning Your Identity Card onto Your Device

Once the digital identity card issuing authority authorizes adding your identity card to Wallet, the information reflected on your identity card is stored in an encrypted format that can be decrypted only using the Secure Enclave on your device. You can view this information at any time by going to Wallet, viewing the back of your identity card, tapping “Driver’s License Info”, “State ID Info”, “Digital ID Info”, or “Card Info” and authenticating to view details. Apple cannot see this information. To learn more about the Secure Enclave, visit support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web.

Protecting Your ID in Wallet

To help protect your ID card from unauthorized access or presentment, you will be asked to tie your ID card to a Face ID appearance or a biometric identifier used for Touch ID. Presenting your ID or information from your ID will require authentication with the specific method and biometric identifier you tied to your ID during set up. Alternative authentication options may be available depending on your device settings. Your device, and not Apple, stores your authentication method. If you would like to change your authentication, you must delete your identity card and add it again to Wallet with the new authentication.

Presenting Your Identity Card

To present your identity card in person, hold your iPhone or Apple Watch near the identity reader to receive a consent sheet with information about who is requesting your identity and the specific information from your identity card being requested. Upon authorization, your device will establish a direct, end-to-end encrypted channel with the identity reader and transmit the authorized information.

When presenting your Digital ID at participating Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints, your Digital ID will provide an indicator that it is an acceptable alternative to REAL ID. Your Digital ID is not a REAL ID document. Other third-party identity readers may also be able to request and receive this indicator. If a third-party identity reader collects this indicator when you present your Digital ID, it will appear on the consent sheet and in your presentment history. Because your Digital ID is created from your passport, when you present your Digital ID, the requesting party may be able to infer that you are a U.S. citizen.

For Japanese identity cards only, you will need to pre-arm your identity card by selecting it in Wallet prior to tapping it on an identity reader to present. When presenting your identity card using Japanese Public Key Infrastructure, Wallet will not display information about the specific information being requested.

Apps requiring proof of age or identity to access their goods or services will present you with a consent sheet showing the specific information being requested, and how long that information will be stored by the requesting app. Upon authorization, your device will transmit an encrypted payload containing the authorized information to the app. The encrypted payload includes a digital signature from the digital identity card issuing authority unique to your identity card to allow the app to verify that your identity card is valid.

You can view past presentments, including when, where, and to whom you presented your identity card, and the specific information presented, by tapping on your identity card in Wallet. This information is generated by your device; neither Apple nor the digital identity card issuing authority know or keep a record of when, where, or to whom you present your identity card. In Japan, the Government of Japan may learn information about your presentment as required to provide requested services, such as when presenting your identity card at hospitals.

Managing Your Identity Card

You can manage your identity card at any time by tapping on your identity card in Wallet. To help protect your privacy and keep your identity card information secure, you will be asked to authenticate before you can view your identity details. To update or change your identity card information, you must contact your government issuing authority. To help manage your identity card in Wallet, your government issuing authority will periodically tell Apple whether your identity card is still valid. Apple will also receive information about any identity card updates from your government issuing authority, such as whether your address was updated or your identity card status was changed (for example, from active to inactive). Apple will not receive details about the update, such as your actual updated address. Apple will retain information about your identity card updates, such as whether your identity card status changed, while you keep an identity card in Wallet; this information will be used only for fraud prevention and security purposes.

Digital IDs do not receive updates when your passport is reissued. To update your Digital ID, you will need to delete your Digital ID and add a new Digital ID using your new passport.

You can delete your identity card from Wallet at any time by going to the back of your identity card in Wallet and tapping “Remove Driver’s License”, “Remove State ID”, “Remove Digital ID”, or “Remove Card”. Removing your identity card will delete all presentment history from your device.

Improving Identity Cards

If you have opted in to provide Apple with this information, Apple will anonymously collect your age, sex, race / ethnicity (if available), and apparent skin tone from your driver’s license or state ID, along with the government issuing authority’s decision about whether to issue you an identity card for Wallet. Apple will use this information to monitor for bias in the identity verification process. You can review this information or change your consent on your iOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements. When you provision through the government issuing authority’s app, you cannot opt in to Improving Identity Cards.

When adding your Digital ID or state identity card to Wallet, Apple may ask you to allow a small team of human reviewers within Apple to look at your Live Photo to help improve the IDs in Wallet experience. If you allow Apple to review your Live Photo, Apple will review and delete your Live Photo within 30 days.

Apple will not use any other information displayed on your identity card itself, such as your name or date of birth, to improve IDs in Wallet. Identity card data that is not linked to you may be retained to improve the feature and other Apple products and services. For example, Apple may retain anonymous and aggregate information about where users have difficulty when adding an identity card to Wallet in order to help improve the experience. Apple may also anonymize information it collects from you or receives from your government issuing authority in connection with this feature in order to improve identity cards in Wallet. For example, Apple will receive information about the quality of images submitted when adding your ID card to Wallet and whether the images were accepted by the government issuing authority. Apple may, for example, anonymize and use this information to help improve your device’s evaluation of the images to be submitted or to help provide users with better instructions on how to take images acceptable to the state issuing authorities.
