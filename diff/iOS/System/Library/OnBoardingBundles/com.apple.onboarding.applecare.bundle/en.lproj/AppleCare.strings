AppleCare Recommendations

When you purchase a new device or enroll in an AppleCare plan on a device you already own, information about your Apple Account will be used to provide you with recommendations about which AppleCare plan to purchase. This includes information like the devices your own, their purchase and activation dates, and whether you are already subscribed to AppleCare. Generally, to enable or disable personalized recommendations on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > Media & Purchases > View Account, then tap Personalized Recommendations. On the Apple Store app, you can control the data you share to be used in recommendations. To change what you share, go to Account > Settings within the Apple Store app, then tap “Your Devices” or “Your Services”. Apple records information about these recommendations identifiably to understand the user journey and to improve our recommendations for AppleCare plans.

AppleCare Payments

You may pay for AppleCare as a fixed term of coverage, a monthly recurring term of coverage (“Monthly Plan”), or for an annual recurring term of coverage (“Annual Plan”). For Monthly and Annual Plans, the cost will be charged to the payment method associated with your Apple Account. If you purchase a Monthly or Annual Plan online at Apple.com, the payment method used will be added to your Apple Account as a nondefault payment method. If you do not have a payment method associated with your Apple Account, we will add the payment method you use for this purchase to your Apple Account to cover the payments for your plan as your default payment method. You may update the payment method associated with your Apple Account at any time on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping. On your Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] > Payment & Shipping.

AppleCare One: Device Eligibility

AppleCare One allows you to enroll in AppleCare with multiple devices and/or compatible accessories. You must be signed in to your Apple Account on all devices you intend to cover with your AppleCare One plan. After you have enrolled, Apple will use information about you and your devices to assess which devices and compatible accessories can be covered immediately, and which devices may need additional diagnostics prior to being eligible for coverage. This eligibility assessment aims to ensure that you get the best coverage your device is eligible for and helps Apple to prevent fraud. Specifically, when you attempt to add a device to your AppleCare One plan, Apple will use information about your Apple Account, devices, and current AppleCare plan coverage, including when you last signed in to iCloud, whether any payments owed to Apple are delinquent, the age of your devices, the country the device is registered in, past repairs and service contacts for the device, and whether the device has been marked as lost using Find My or reported as stolen, in order to make this decision. In some cases, Apple may require additional diagnostics prior to allowing you to enroll the device or accessory, including but not limited to, a test call or messaging, remote functional and cosmetic diagnostics, and/or a physical, in-store assessment. Where Apple requires you to submit remote diagnostics to assess eligibility, you will see additional information about the data we will collect prior to its submission.

Support and Service

Apple may use information about your Apple Account, devices, and AppleCare plan when you request support and service. This information, which includes personal data like your contact information, information about your location, device serial numbers, financial account information, and other information that you may provide, will be used to authenticate you, triage and troubleshoot your issue, communicate with you, provide you with refunds where necessary, protect against fraud, and improve Apple’s products or services.

Sharing with Third Parties

Apple may share the information we collect with third-party service providers and our insurance partner in order to support certain aspects of your AppleCare plan. For example, Apple will share your contact information and device identifiers with our insurance partner when you enroll in AppleCare, cancel a contract, enroll or unenroll a device on your AppleCare One plan, or initiate a theft and loss claim.

Communicating with You

Apple may use information about your Apple Account and devices to communicate with you about your AppleCare plan. This may include messages related to payments and purchases, providing you with invoices or receipts, and communicating about your claims and about your devices. Apple may also use information about your Apple Account, such as the Apple products you own and your subscriptions to Apple services, to send you communications about Apple products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you. You may receive these communications by email, if you consent to receive email marketing. Apple uses information about your interactions with our communications, including notifications, to improve our services. You can change your email preferences and opt out of receiving some of these emails by going to account.apple.com, or on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > Personal Information > Communication Preferences. On your Mac, go to System Settings > [your name] > Personal Information > Communication Preferences.

Analytics

Apple collects identifiable information about your purchase experience and interactions with AppleCare, including the eligibility process, plan sales, device provisioning, and service events. Such information may be used for business and internal research and analytics to operate and help improve the service, for marketing, and for fraud prevention and security purposes.
