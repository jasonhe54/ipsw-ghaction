"SECTION1_PARAGRAPH2" = "Aging is one of the primary causes for hearing loss. Generally, you can hear more when you’re younger and less as you get older. A quarter of people over 50 and half of people over 80 experience hearing loss. This typically occurs as your ear changes over time and is most often due to the loss of the hair cells in the inner ear that sense sound. Hearing loss can also be genetic or even caused by certain diseases such as meningitis, mumps, and chickenpox.";

Moderate loss means you can hear a raised voice. With Severe loss, the words need to be shouted but with Profound loss, you probably cannot hear words that are shouted.";
"SECTION1_PARAGRAPH5" = "Hearing loss can be hard to detect on your own because it often happens gradually. A quick, painless test can tell you if you have any loss and it’s a good idea to check your hearing yearly. The result of the test is an audiogram or chart of your hearing. Any change in your hearing is measured in decibels of hearing level (dBHL) and the chart represents how loud a sound needs to be in order for you to hear it. The test will also provide a single number to represent your ability to hear speech in each ear. This number is the average hearing loss at the four frequencies most important for speech. This average is often used to help determine if you would benefit from treatment, such as a hearing aid.";
