These keyboards can access all of the data you type, including bank account and credit card numbers, street addresses, as well as other personal and sensitive information. These keyboards may also access nearby text or data, which is useful for improving autocorrect functionality.

If you enable Full Access, developers are permitted to access, collect and transmit the data you type. In addition, if the third party application containing the keyboard has your permission to access location, photos, or other personal data, the keyboard can also collect and transmit that information to the keyboard developer’s servers. If you disable Full Access for a third party keyboard, and then re-enable it, the keyboard’s developer may be able to access, collect and transmit what was typed while the network access was disabled.

If you do not enable Full Access, developers are not permitted to collect and transmit the data you type. Any unauthorized collection or transmission of this data without your permission would be a violation of their developer agreement. Furthermore, there are also technical limitations in effect to prevent unauthorized access.  Any attempt to defeat these limitations would also be a violation of their developer agreement.

You may choose to disable a third party keyboard at any time. To do so, open Settings, tap Keyboards, and remove the keyboard from the Keyboard list.

If you use a third party keyboard, you are subject to the keyboard developer’s terms, privacy policy and practices. You should review the terms, privacy policies and practices of such keyboard apps and services to understand how they use your data and other information prior to use.";
