This is because your body needs to take in more oxygen and get rid of more carbon dioxide. When you exercise regularly, you increase the strength and efficiency of your muscles, so they are better at taking in oxygen. In addition, your heart and lungs get more efficient at delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. For these reasons, the more fit you are, the lower your respiratory rate will likely be.";
