"APP_CLIPS_LEARN_MORE" = "App clips are small parts of an app that allow you to complete a task quickly and without downloading the entire app. App clips can be invoked in several ways, including by scanning an app clip or QR code, tapping an app clip NFC tag, entering an app clip from a link sent via iMessage or launching an app clip from a Smart App Banner in Safari. App clips can also be suggested by Siri or in Apple Maps.

When you launch an app clip, your device sends to Apple information about which app clip to retrieve and download to your device. This information does not reveal what link, tag, or code you interacted with to launch the app clip. For users who have opted into sharing device analytics with Apple, your device will send some limited, non-personally identifiable information from your use of app clips to help improve app clips and other Apple products and services for you and others.

App clip developers may separately collect information about you through the app clip, and if you upgrade from the app clip to the full app your data may be transferred to the app. For more information about the developer’s handling of your data you should consult the App Store product page for the full app and the developer's privacy policy.";

"LOCATION_CONFIRMATION_SECTION" = "When you invoke an app clip from an NFC tag or QR code, the app clip may ask to confirm your location. Location confirmation helps the developer understand if the NFC tag or QR code has been moved from its intended location. If you allow app clips to confirm your location, your device will send the app clip a “yes” or “no” indication of whether the location of your device is in proximity to the location selected by the app clip developer. The app clip does not receive your precise location through location confirmation.

The first time an app clip asks to confirm your location, you will be asked if you want to apply your choice to all app clips. If you apply your choice to all app clips by selecting Allow for All App Clips or Don’t Allow, you will not be prompted again to confirm your location. If you choose Allow Once, you will be asked again by each app clip each time the app clip would like to confirm your location. After you’ve set your choice, you can modify your selection on the app clip card shown the first time you launch the app clip. You can also enable and disable location confirmation in Settings by going to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > App Clips and changing your setting for Confirm Location.

If the app clip would like access to your device’s location data as part of the app clip’s experience, the developer can separately request access to location services.  If you give permission, the access will last for one day, and only while you are using the app clip.";
