Installing this AirPods Firmware Profile will allow you to install the AirPods firmware update on your device and may provide you with access to Apple tools so that you may help Apple troubleshoot issues with your device and help Apple to improve AirPods and related products and services.

This version of the AirPods firmware is only for use by members of the Apple Developer Program.  Please be sure to backup your devices and archive that backup prior to installing the AirPods firmware.  Once the firmware is installed, it cannot be removed and the AirPods cannot be restored to previously-released OS versions.  After installation of the AirPods firmware, do not insert any un-updated earbuds into the charging case, because they may be updated with the firmware.  Attempting to install this version of the AirPods firmware in an unauthorized manner could put your device in an unusable state, which could necessitate an out of warranty repair.  If you need assistance restoring your device, please contact AppleCare by visiting https://support.apple.com.
