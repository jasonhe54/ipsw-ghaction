"FOOTER_TEXT" = "With your consent, Exposure Notifications can be used by a government or public health authority (collectively, the “Public Health Authority”) to notify you if you may have been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. You can choose to install a Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications app to do this or, if the Public Health Authority has taken steps to enable it in its region, you can choose to activate Exposure Notifications without downloading an app. You must choose to enable Exposure Notifications; it is not on by default. In addition, you do not need to have Location Services enabled to use Exposure Notifications.

If you choose to enable Exposure Notifications, you will be asked for permission for your device to collect and share random identifiers. This will allow your device to broadcast via Bluetooth a random identifier (the “Bluetooth Identifiers”), a string of random numbers that changes every 10–20 minutes. The Bluetooth Identifiers are generated on your device using a cryptographic routine from a randomly generated key that changes at least once every 24 hours to further protect your privacy (the “Random Device Keys”). The Bluetooth Identifiers and the Random Device Keys do not include your location information or identity.

Other devices that have Exposure Notifications enabled will be listening for these Bluetooth Identifiers and broadcasting theirs as well. Your device will record and securely store the identifiers of those other devices that are in Bluetooth range, along with associated metadata, such as the date, estimated duration of the exposure, and information about the Bluetooth signal strength (“Associated Metadata”). The Bluetooth signal strength can help provide a general understanding of the proximity of the devices; generally, the closer the devices are, the higher the signal strength recorded. Other devices that receive your device’s Bluetooth Identifiers will similarly record and store them with Associated Metadata. The Bluetooth Identifiers, Random Device Keys, and Associated Metadata are deleted from your device on a rolling 14-day window. You can also delete this data by following the instructions in the You Have Choice & Control section below.

Random Device Keys from individuals who have reported that they have COVID-19 and chosen to share their keys with the Public Health Authority can be downloaded to your device. Following download, the keys will be checked against the Bluetooth Identifiers your device has collected and stored from other devices. If there are any matches, you may be notified if you are at risk of exposure based on parameters set by the Public Health Authority for your active region, and it can provide you with guidance, such as recommending that you get tested or self-quarantine. If there are any matches and you’ve installed the Exposure Notifications app associated with the Public Health Authority for your active region, the Associated Metadata (but not the matched identifier) and how the diagnosis was reported (such as confirmed by test, clinical diagnosis, or self-report) is made available to the app. If enabled by the Public Health Authority, when reporting a positive diagnosis your Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications app can also attach information to the keys you release to the Public Health Authority to inform them if you are reporting a COVID-19 variant that they have identified as a concern. All of this can help the Public Health Authority tailor its guidance to you and help it manage the COVID-19 pandemic. This information is not shared with Apple.

You can manage this feature by going to Settings > Exposure Notifications. There, you may select and activate a Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications. If you have Location Services on, then your device can notify you if you are in a region where the Public Health Authority has made Exposure Notifications available without requiring an app. In addition, if you have Significant Locations on, then your device can notify you if Exposure Notifications are available without requiring an app on a subregion basis (for example, per state or province if that is how the region has chosen to offer Exposure Notifications). Location information to determine whether to display these availability alerts is processed on-device, and Exposure Notifications does not send your device location to the Public Health Authority or Apple. You can disable availability alerts by going to Settings > Exposure Notifications and tapping to turn off Availability Alerts. You can also go to the App Store to download a Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications app, if it has one available.

While you can authorize more than one Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications, only one region’s Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications can be active at a time. You will be notified of potential exposures based on the parameters set by the Public Health Authority for your active region. In order to select or change your active region, go to Settings > Exposure Notifications.

If you have activated Exposure Notifications for a region where the Public Health Authority does not require an app, the Public Health Authority may ask you to share limited non-personally identifying analytics data so that it may calculate aggregate statistics to help it improve its Exposure Notifications and COVID-19 containment efforts. The analytics data is encrypted and cannot be read by Apple, and is not linked to you or your phone. Analytics may include the level of exposure that triggered a notification and whether you tapped on it. Analytics are protected using differential privacy and cryptographic tools. This enables Public Health Authorities to gain insight into aggregate statistics while protecting the privacy of individual users. The aggregate statistics can help Public Health Authorities determine if their containment efforts are working and evaluate their risk parameters. You can change your analytics setting for a Public Health Authority by going to Settings > Exposure Notifications and changing the Share Analytics setting. You can also tap Analytics Data to see more information about the data shared with the Public Health Authority.

Sharing a Diagnosis

If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 or present potential exposure risk based on guidelines determined by a Public Health Authority that offers Exposure Notifications, you can choose to report that and consent to share your Random Device Keys with them. As described above, this will allow keys to be downloaded by other devices that have Exposure Notifications enabled and checked against the Bluetooth Identifiers those devices have collected to determine if there was a potential exposure. Again, your Random Device Keys do not include your location information or identity. The Public Health Authority may also define and send metadata related to your transmission risk with each key, including how the diagnosis was reported (such as confirmed by test, clinical diagnosis, or self-report), whether you have been diagnosed with a COVID-19 variant identified by the Public Health Authority as a concern, and the days since symptom onset.

If you have a Public Health Authority’s app installed, you can share a diagnosis in the app. If you take a COVID-19 test, the Public Health Authority may ask if you would like to share your Random Device Keys if the test comes back positive so that others can be notified of potential exposure. If you consent and then test positive, you will receive a notification when the keys are shared. If you consent and change your mind before the keys are shared, you can go to Settings > Exposure Notifications and tap to turn off Automatically Notify Others.

If you have activated Exposure Notifications for a region where the Public Health Authority does not require an app, it may provide you with instructions on how to share a diagnosis or you can go to Settings > Exposure Notifications.

Information you choose to provide to the Public Health Authority is collected under its own legal terms, including its privacy policy (available when enabling the Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications and subsequently in Settings > Exposure Notifications), and its own legal obligations, and such information is not shared with Apple.

If You Travel

If you travel outside your active region, knowing that can help the Public Health Authority share Random Device Keys so that you and others can be notified of potential exposures. If you have a Public Health Authority’s Exposure Notifications app and you have Location Services enabled, it may, therefore, ask if you would like to share your travel status. If a Public Health Authority has made its Exposure Notifications app available for a subregion (for example, per state or province) and you have Significant Locations enabled, your travel status can let the Public Health Authority know that you traveled outside the subregion. Your travel status can guide the Public Health Authority to share with or download keys from other regions’ Public Health Authorities. Location information is processed on-device and your travel status only indicates whether you’ve traveled outside your active Exposure Notifications region in the past 14 days. Exposure Notifications does not send your device location to the Public Health Authority or Apple. You can go to Settings > Exposure Notifications and select the Public Health Authority app to change your Share Travel Status setting. You can also turn off Location Services by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services, or Significant Locations by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services and tapping to turn off Significant Locations.

If you have activated Exposure Notifications for a Public Health Authority that does not require an app and you choose to share a diagnosis, the Public Health Authority may ask if you have traveled over the past 14 days. This informs the Public Health Authority that you have traveled, but not your location or where you’ve traveled. In addition, if you have Location Services enabled, your device can download keys from other regions you have traveled to over the past 14 days that have also enabled Exposure Notifications. If you have Significant Locations on, your device can also do this on a subregion basis (for example, per state or province). Location information is processed on-device, and Exposure Notifications does not send your device location to the Public Health Authority or Apple. You can turn off Location Services and Significant Locations by following the instructions above.

You Have Choice and Control

You can disable Exposure Notifications by going to Settings > Exposure Notifications and tapping Turn Off Exposure Notifications. This will also delete the Bluetooth Identifiers recorded from other devices, Associated Metadata, your Random Device Keys, and your Exposure Notifications regions (but Exposure Notifications apps you’ve installed won’t be deleted). You can also delete the Bluetooth identifiers, Associated Metadata, and Random Device Keys by going to Settings > Exposure Notifications > Exposure Logging, and tapping Delete Exposure Log. If you turn off Bluetooth on your device by going to Settings > Bluetooth, that will disable the sharing and collection of random Bluetooth Identifiers with other devices. This means that the Public Health Authority for your active region won’t be able to notify you about exposures to someone with COVID-19 that occur while Bluetooth is off. The remaining features of Exposure Notifications will continue to operate while you have Bluetooth turned off. Turning Bluetooth back on will reenable the sharing and collection of random Bluetooth Identifiers with other devices.

Apple will disable the Exposure Notification system on a regional basis when it is no longer needed.";
