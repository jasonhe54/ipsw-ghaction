For more information, visit www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/improve-siri-dictation.

Siri and Dictation

When you talk or type to Siri, your request is processed on-device whenever possible.

When you talk to Siri, your device will indicate in Settings whether the things you say are processed on your device and not sent to Apple servers. Otherwise, your audio is sent to and processed on Apple servers. Unless you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation, your audio data is not stored by Apple. In all cases, transcripts of your interactions will be sent to Apple to process your requests and may be stored by Apple.

When you use Dictation, your device will indicate in Keyboard Settings if your audio and transcripts are processed on your device and not sent to Apple servers. Otherwise, the things you dictate are sent to and processed on the server, but will not be stored unless you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation.

Apple will also store related request data, such as the category of request you made and whether it was completed successfully, device specifications, device configuration, performance statistics, and, if you have turned on Location Services for Siri, the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

Your Siri transcripts and any related request data are associated with a random, device-generated identifier that rotates multiple times per hour and is not tied to your Apple Account or email address. Apple may retain and use this data for up to two years to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, Search, and limited other language processing functionality in Apple products and services. For example, transcripts may be used to fine-tune Siri, Search, Voice Control, Translate, and automatic speech recognition models. Apple may also review a subset of the transcripts of your interactions with Siri, and this small subset of interactions that has been reviewed may be kept beyond two years for the ongoing improvement of these products and services.

A history of your Siri and Dictation interactions is stored on your device, and may be used to personalize your Siri experience.

When you use Siri and Dictation, your device may send other contextual data to Apple, including from third-party apps you allow to integrate with Use with Siri Requests, such as:

• Contact names, nicknames, and relationships (for example, “my dad”), if you set them up in your contacts
• Form of address, if set in language and region settings
• Music and podcasts you enjoy
• Names of your and your Family Sharing members’ devices
• Names of accessories, homes, scenes, shared home members in the Home app, and Apple TV user profiles
• Labels for items, such as people names in Photos, Alarm names, and names of Reminders lists
• Names of apps installed on your device and shortcuts you added through Siri

This data is associated with a random, device-generated identifier that is not tied to your Apple Account or email address. It is used by Apple only to determine whether Siri understood your request and to help your iPadOS device and any connected Apple device, such as your Apple Watch, HomePod, or supported HomeKit accessory, understand you better and recognize what you say.

This contextual data, as well as your Siri transcripts and related request data, are not used to build a marketing profile, and are never sold to anyone.

Third-Party Apps

When Siri interacts with a third-party app or service on your behalf, you are subject to that app or service’s terms and conditions and privacy policy. In addition, if you choose to allow apps to use Speech Recognition for transcription, the audio data to be transcribed may be sent to Apple.

Siri Suggestions

Siri Suggestions uses local, on-device processing to learn how you use your devices and apps in order to personalize your experience. Using information stored on your device, such as your Safari browsing history, emails, messages, images, notifications, and contacts, as well as information donated or contributed by other installed apps, Siri can suggest shortcuts and provide suggestions in searches, share sheet, calendar, Look Up, Visual Look Up, Safari, apps, and more. For example, Siri may use on-device intelligence to suggest who to share a photo with in share sheet based on who is in the photo. Suggestions may be used to personalize Apple services but are not stored on Apple servers or shared with other third-party apps. When you run a Siri-suggested shortcut, you are subject to the app’s terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Location Services

If you have Location Services turned on for Siri, the location of your device at the time you make a request will be sent to Apple to help Siri and Dictation improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. To deliver relevant responses and suggestions, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.

iCloud Syncing

Your Siri settings and Siri Suggestions personalization will sync across your Apple devices using end-to-end encryption if you use iCloud. If you have set up Siri, a small sample of your requests will also sync using end-to-end encryption to improve personalized Siri recognition on each device. The personalized speech recognition models and your interactions with Siri and Dictation that are performed on device may leverage your on-device information to improve accuracy and model performance. The status of your nearby timers, alarms, shared media, and, if you opted in to Personal Requests on HomePod, phone call status, from your device and the proximity of such device may be shared locally with your nearby Apple devices for others to be able to control them from your nearby devices with Siri enabled.

Siri and Dictation

When you use Siri, your device will indicate in Siri Settings whether the things you say are processed on your device and not sent to Siri servers. Otherwise, your audio is sent to and processed on Apple servers. Unless you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation, your audio data is not stored by Apple. In all cases, transcripts of your interactions will be sent to Apple to process your requests and may be stored by Apple.

When you use Dictation, your device will indicate in Keyboard Settings if your audio and transcripts are processed on your device and not sent to Apple servers. Otherwise, the things you dictate are sent to and processed on the server, but will not be stored unless you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation.

Apple will also store related request data, such as the category of request you made and whether it was completed successfully, device specifications, device configuration, performance statistics, and, if you have turned on Location Services for Siri, the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

Your request history, which includes transcripts and any related request data, is associated with a random identifier that rotates multiple times per hour and is not tied to your Apple Account or email address. Apple may retain and use this data for up to two years to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, Search, and limited other language processing functionality in Apple products and services. For example, transcripts may be used to fine-tune Siri, Search, Voice Control, Translate, and automatic speech recognition models. Apple may also review a subset of the transcripts of your interactions and this small subset of interactions that has been reviewed may be kept beyond two years for the ongoing improvement of these products and services.

When you use Siri and Dictation, your device will send other contextual data to Apple, including from third-party apps you allow to integrate with Use with Siri Requests, such as:

• Contact names, nicknames, and relationships (for example, “my dad”), if you set them up in your contacts
• Form of address, if set in language and region settings
• Music and podcasts you enjoy
• Names of your and your Family Sharing members’ devices
• Names of accessories, homes, scenes, shared home members in the Home app, and Apple TV user profiles
• Labels for items, such as people names in Photos, Alarm names, and names of Reminders lists
• Names of apps installed on your device and shortcuts you added through Siri

This data is associated with a random, device-generated identifier and is not linked to your Apple Account or email address. It is used to help your iOS device and any connected Apple device, such as Apple Watch, HomePod, or supported HomeKit accessory understand you better and recognize what you say.

This contextual data, as well as your Siri transcripts and related request data, are not used to build a marketing profile, and are never sold to anyone.

Otherwise, your audio is sent to and processed on Apple servers. Unless you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation, your audio data is not stored by Apple.

When you enable Apple Intelligence on your device, Apple processes and stores only your transcripts, including your transcribed and typed interactions, when you use Siri to look up general knowledge, search the web, and do things like play music and get directions. Otherwise, transcripts of your interactions with Siri are not stored by Apple. If you do not want transcripts of your search requests to be stored by Apple, you can turn off search logging by going to Settings > Search and tapping to turn off Help Apple Improve Search.

If you do not have Apple Intelligence enabled on your device, your Siri transcripts may be processed and stored by Apple.

When you use Dictation, your device will indicate in Keyboard Settings if your audio and transcripts are processed on your device and not sent to Apple servers. Otherwise, the things you dictate are sent to and processed on the server, but will not be stored unless you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation.

Apple will also store related request data, such as the category of request you made and whether it was completed successfully, device specifications, device configuration, performance statistics, and, if you have turned on Location Services for Siri, the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

Your Siri transcripts and any related request data are associated with a random, device-generated identifier that rotates multiple times per hour and is not tied to your Apple Account or email address. Apple may retain and use this data for up to two years to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, Search, and limited other language processing functionality in Apple products and services. For example, transcripts may be used to fine-tune Siri, Search, Voice Control, Translate, and automatic speech recognition models. Apple may also review a subset of the transcripts of your interactions with Siri, and this small subset of interactions that has been reviewed may be kept beyond two years for the ongoing improvement of these products and services.

A history of your Siri and Dictation interactions is stored on your device, and may be used to personalize your Siri experience.

When you use Siri and Dictation, your device may send other contextual data to Apple, including from third-party apps you allow to integrate with Use with Siri Requests, such as:

• Contact names, nicknames, and relationships (for example, “my dad”), if you set them up in your contacts
• Form of address, if set in language and region settings
• Music and podcasts you enjoy
• Names of your and your Family Sharing members’ devices
• Names of accessories, homes, scenes, shared home members in the Home app, and Apple TV user profiles
• Labels for items, such as people names in Photos, Alarm names, and names of Reminders lists
• Names of apps installed on your device and shortcuts you added through Siri

This data is associated with a random, device-generated identifier that is not tied to your Apple Account or email address. It is used by Apple only to determine whether Siri understood your request and to help your iPadOS device and any connected Apple device, such as your Apple Watch, HomePod, or supported HomeKit accessory, understand you better and recognize what you say.

This contextual data, as well as your Siri transcripts and related request data, are not used to build a marketing profile, and are never sold to anyone.

Third-Party Apps

When Siri interacts with a third-party app or service on your behalf, you are subject to that app or service’s terms and conditions and privacy policy. In addition, if you choose to allow apps to use Speech Recognition for transcription, the audio data to be transcribed may be sent to Apple.

ChatGPT Extension

When you choose to enable the ChatGPT extension in Siri, Apple processes and stores your transcripts, including your transcribed and typed requests. Apple also stores related request data when using the ChatGPT extension in Siri, such as the category of request you made and whether it was completed successfully. This data is part of your Siri transcripts and related request history, and is used and retained by Apple as described above.

Apple collects limited information about ChatGPT’s response back to you, such as the approximate size of the response, in order to operate the service and prevent fraud. For more information, visit www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/chatgpt-extension.

Connected Apple Devices

Using Siri on a connected Apple device, such as an Apple Watch or HomePod, may require additional server processing of your audio and transcripts. For more information, see the Siri Settings for your connected Apple device.

Siri Suggestions

Siri Suggestions uses local, on-device processing to learn how you use your devices and apps in order to personalize your experience. Using information stored on your device, such as your Safari browsing history, emails, messages, images, notifications, and contacts, as well as information donated or contributed by other installed apps, Siri can suggest shortcuts and provide suggestions in searches, share sheet, calendar, Look Up, Visual Look Up, Safari, apps, and more. For example, Siri may use on-device intelligence to suggest who to share a photo with in share sheet based on who is in the photo. Suggestions may be used to personalize Apple services but are not stored on Apple servers or shared with other third-party apps. When you run a Siri-suggested shortcut, you are subject to the app’s terms and conditions and privacy policy.

Location Services

If you have Location Services turned on for Siri, the location of your device at the time you make a request will be sent to Apple to help Siri and Dictation improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. To deliver relevant responses and suggestions, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.

iCloud Syncing

Your Siri settings and Siri Suggestions personalization will sync across your Apple devices using end-to-end encryption if you use iCloud. If you have set up Siri, a small sample of your requests will also sync using end-to-end encryption to improve personalized Siri recognition on each device. The personalized speech recognition models and your interactions with Siri and Dictation that are performed on device may leverage your on-device information to improve accuracy and model performance. The status of your nearby timers, alarms, shared media, and, if you opted in to Personal Requests on HomePod, phone call status, from your device and the proximity of such device may be shared locally with your nearby Apple devices for others to be able to control them from your nearby devices with Siri enabled.

To deliver relevant responses and suggestions, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.

iCloud Syncing

Your Siri settings and Siri Suggestions personalization will sync across your Apple devices using end-to-end encryption if you use iCloud. If you have set up Siri, a small sample of your requests will also sync using end-to-end encryption to improve personalized Siri recognition on each device. The personalized speech recognition models and your interactions with Siri and Dictation that are performed on device may leverage your on-device information to improve accuracy and model performance. The status of your nearby timers, alarms, shared media, and, if you opted in to Personal Requests on HomePod, phone call status, from your device and the proximity of such device may be shared locally with your nearby Apple devices for others to be able to control them from your nearby devices with Siri enabled.

Siri

When you use Siri, the things you say will be sent to Apple servers to process your requests. Unless you opt in to Improve Siri and Dictation, your audio data is not stored by Apple. In all cases, transcripts of your interactions will be sent to Apple to process your requests and may be stored by Apple.

Apple will also store related request data, such as the category of request you made and whether it was completed successfully, device specifications, device configuration, performance statistics, and, if you have turned on Location Services for Siri, the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

Your request history, which includes Siri transcripts and any related request data, is associated with a random identifier for up to six months and is not tied to your Apple Account or email address. After six months, your request history is disassociated from the random identifier and may be retained for up to two years. Apple may use this data to develop and improve Siri, Dictation, Search, and limited other language processing functionality in Apple products and services. For example, transcripts may be used to fine-tune Siri, Search, Voice Control, Translate, and automatic speech recognition models. Apple may also review a subset of the transcripts of your interactions with Siri, and this small subset of interactions that has been reviewed may be kept beyond two years for the ongoing improvement of these products and services.

When you use Siri, your device will send contextual data to Apple, including from third-party apps you allow to integrate with Use with Siri Requests, such as:

• Contact names, nicknames, and relationships (for example, “my dad”), if you set them up in your contacts
• Music and podcasts you enjoy
• Names of your and your Family Sharing members’ devices
• Names of accessories, homes, scenes, shared home members in the Home app, and Apple TV user profiles
• Labels for items, such as people names in Photos, Alarm names, and names of Reminders lists
• Names of apps installed on your device and shortcuts you added through Siri

This data is associated with a random, device-generated identifier and is not linked to your Apple Account or email address. It is used by Apple only to determine whether Siri understood your request and to help your iPod understand you better and recognize what you say.

This contextual data, as well as your Siri transcripts and related request data, are not used to build a marketing profile, and are never sold to anyone.

Third-Party Apps

When Siri interacts with a third-party app on your behalf, you are subject to that app’s terms and conditions and privacy policy. If you choose to allow apps to use Speech Recognition, the voice data to be transcribed may be sent to Apple.

Location Services
