Using Shazam Music Recognition

You can use the Shazam Music Recognition app on Apple Watch to identify a song that is playing. Shazam Music Recognition sends certain data about your song request, including a unique audio fingerprint for each song, to Apple to process and help recognize your Shazam Music Recognition request. By default, Shazam Music Recognition requests are associated with a random, device-generated identifier that is not linked to your Apple Account.

When you are signed in to your Apple Account and have two-factor authentication enabled, Shazam Music Recognition will use iCloud to save your recognized Shazam Music Recognition requests in iCloud where it is encrypted while in transit and at rest. You can disable iCloud syncing from your iOS or iPadOS device by going to Settings > [your name] > iCloud and tapping to turn off Shazam Music Recognition. When you disable iCloud syncing for Shazam Music Recognition, your Shazam Music Recognition requests saved to iCloud will remain in your Apple Account, but new requests will not be added from Shazam Music Recognition. You can manage your Shazam Music Recognition history by going to the History tab in the app.

You can also use Shazam Music Recognition to identify songs from Control Center, Siri, and other features on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Learn more about how to add and use Shazam Music Recognition in Control Center, Siri, and more at support.apple.com/118570.
