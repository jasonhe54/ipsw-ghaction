"APPLE_BALANCE_METRICS_SUMMARY" = "This is a collection of measurements, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature that are taken by Apple Watch while you sleep. Together, these measurements can help you understand how your body is doing. Short-term changes can be a signal that something might be going on.
Each of the metrics is compared to your baseline range. It takes about a week’s worth of sleep sessions to establish your baseline ranges and they’ll continue to refine if you consistently wear your Apple Watch to bed. Make sure your watch isn’t loose on your wrist and that Sleep is on.
A variety of factors can push your vitals out of your typical range, creating an outlier. Caffeine, illness, traveling to higher elevation, exercise, or alcohol are just a few of the factors that can affect your metrics.
Vitals is not designed to detect illness or a medical condition. If you’re concerned about a change in your health, you should speak with a doctor.";
