Your iOS device can automatically collect diagnostic and usage information about your iOS device and any paired Apple Watch and send it to Apple for analysis, but only with your explicit consent.

Apple Watch Analytics may include details about hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics, and data about how you use your devices and applications. None of the collected information identifies you personally. Personal data is either not logged at all, is subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy, or is removed from any reports before they’re sent to Apple. You can review this information by going to Settings on your iOS device, tapping Privacy & Security, tapping Analytics & Improvements and looking under Analytics Data.

If you have consented to provide Apple with this information, and you have Location Services turned on, the location of your devices may also be sent to help Apple analyze performance issues (for example, the strength or weakness of a mobile signal in a particular location). This diagnostic location data may include locations such as the location of your devices once per day, the location where a call ends or the location of a failed in-store transaction. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Diagnostics at any time. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy & Security, tap Location Services, tap System Services and turn off the Apple Watch Analytics switch.

You may also choose to turn off Apple Watch Analytics altogether. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy & Security, tap Analytics, and set “Share iPhone & Watch Analytics” to off.

To help Apple’s partners and third-party developers improve their apps, products and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may provide such partners or developers with a subset of diagnostic information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s app, product or service, as well as statistics about how you use that partner’s or developer’s app, as long as the diagnostic information and statistics are aggregated or in a form that does not personally identify you.

You may choose not to share crash data and statistics about how you use apps with third-party app developers. To do so, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Privacy & Security, tap Analytics, and turn off Share With App Developers. If Share iPhone & Watch Analytics is disabled, sharing crash data and statistics about how you use their apps with third-party app developers is automatically turned off.

By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing and use of this information as described above.

Your device will also send Apple other information, such as your name and nickname; the names, nicknames, and relationship with you (e.g., “my dad”) of your contacts, song names in your collection, HomeKit-enabled devices in your home (e.g., “living room lights”), the names of your photo albums, the names of Apps installed on your device (collectively, your “User Data”). All of this data is used to help Siri and Dictation on your iOS device and any paired Apple Watch understand you better and recognize what you say. It is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services.

If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your device at the time you make a request will also be sent to Apple to help Siri and Dictation improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Siri. To do so, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Privacy, tap Location Services, tap Siri & Dictation and select “Never”.

If you choose to allow third party Apps to integrate with Siri, some data from these Apps may be sent to Apple to help Siri understand your request, and portions of your request will be shared with the App to help provide a response or take an action (e.g., make a reservation at a restaurant or book a ride).  If you choose to allow Apps to use Siri for transcription, the voice data to be transcribed may be sent to Apple.  You may control which Apps can integrate with Siri at any time under Siri Settings.

You may choose to turn off Siri or Dictation at any time. To turn off Siri, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Siri, and slide the Siri switch to “off”. To turn off Dictation, open Settings, tap General, tap Keyboard, and slide the Enable Dictation switch to “off”.  If you turn off both Siri and Dictation, Apple will delete your User Data, as well as your recent voice input data. Older voice input data that has been disassociated from you may be retained for a period of time to generally improve Siri, Dictation and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services. This voice input data may include audio files and transcripts of what you said, related diagnostic data, such as hardware and operating system specifications and performance statistics, and the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

You can also restrict the ability to use Siri & Dictation altogether under the Restrictions Setting.

By using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input, User Data, and other data that may be sent to Apple by Apps that integrate with Siri, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
