If you have opted in to sharing analytics with Apple and app developers, Apple collects information about your browser choice interactions, including what you tap and view, and the positioning of browsers on the selection page. Apple preserves your privacy when collecting this data and does not associate it with you. The data may be used to improve the browser choice experience and for Apple’s reporting and compliance purposes. You may change your analytics sharing preferences at any time. To do so on your iOS or iPadOS device, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, and tap to turn off Share [device] Analytics.

When you select a browser app that you do not currently have on your device, the app will be automatically downloaded from the App Store and set as your default browser. As part of this download, identifiers such as your device’s hardware ID and IP address are logged by Apple in association with your Apple Account. When you use the App Store, information about your downloads, including the download of your default browser app, may be used as described in App Store & Privacy at www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/app-store.

You may change your default browser at any time. To do so, go to Settings > Apps, tap the app you would like to set as your default browser, then tap Default Browser App. Select the app to set it as your default. A checkmark will appear next to the app to confirm it is the default.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
