You can manage your emergency contacts by editing your Medical ID in the Health app on iPhone.

For a limited period of time, your device will send updates to your emergency contacts as your location changes. You’ll receive a notification when this happens.

When you use Emergency SOS on your iPhone you may stop these updates by tapping the status bar on your iPhone and selecting Stop Sharing Emergency Location.

If Location Services is disabled, it will be temporarily enabled in order to notify your emergency contacts with your location. If you don’t want to send your location to your emergency contacts, open Settings on your iPhone, tap Privacy, tap Location Services, tap System Services, and turn off Emergency SOS.";
