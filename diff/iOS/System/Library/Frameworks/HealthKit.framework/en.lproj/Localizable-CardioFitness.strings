A higher VO₂ max indicates a higher level of cardio fitness and endurance.
Measuring VO₂ max requires a physical test and special equipment. You can also get an estimated VO₂ max with heart rate and motion data from a fitness tracker. Apple Watch can record an estimated VO₂ max when you do a brisk walk, hike, or run outdoors.
VO₂ max is classified for users 20 and older. Most people can improve their VO₂ max with more intense and more frequent cardiovascular exercise. Certain conditions or medications that limit your heart rate may cause an overestimation of your VO₂ max. VO₂ max is not validated for pregnant users. You can indicate you’re taking certain medications or add a current pregnancy in Health Details.";
