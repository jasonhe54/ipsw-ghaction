"ELS_HEALTH_CONSENT_HERMIT_CONTENT" = "This diagnostic session collects logs that allow Apple to troubleshoot issues with how hypertension notifications are established on your Apple Watch and iPhone and helps Apple to improve its products and services. The generated files may include information such as some of your personal information, including sensitive health information entered in the Health app (such as information you log in Cycle Tracking, health data you choose to share with others through the Health app Health Sharing features, and information related to your usage of the hypertension notification feature), your settings for certain health features you enable (such as settings for the Heart Rate functionality), your workout activity, and whether Apple Watch was worn on your wrist at particular times, historical accelerometer data, 90 days of historical possible hypertension calculations and timestamps, 90 days of historical background heart rate, resting heart rate, heart rate variability data, and 90 days of historical sleep data. Date of last possible hypertension analysis, possible hypertension calculations and timestamps, results of hypertension analysis including number of days recorded, historical possible hypertension calculations, date of when feature is enabled, wrist state history, charger state history, heart rate measurements (workout heart rate, breathe heart rate, resting heart rate, sleep heart rate, blood oxygen heart rate, and background heart rate), high/low heart rate alert information, wrist state (on/off wrist), workout data (such as heart rate and calorimetry), blood oxygen saturation level, barometric pressure, Breathe sessions state changes, beat-to-beat heart rate measurements, optical sensor data (such as indicative of heart rate and wrist detection), heart rate notification settings, sleep related settings and results, respiration rate data, logs indicating motion present on your watch and phone that were generated in the last 7 days.  In addition, if you agree to this consent, Apple Watch and iPhone sysdiagnose logging will be enabled on your device. The sysdiagnose logs may include information such as your name, your username, your email address and email settings, features enabled on your Apple Watch and iPhone, the apps you use while logging is enabled, file paths, file names, downloads, network connection information, and other details including health feature availability, your settings for certain Health features (e.g., your Heart Rate settings), and hypertension calculations usage data. These logs may include data that could personally identify you.

The log collection period is approximately 24 hours. The logs will include current and historic log data. You will be able to turn off logging at any time while the logs are being collected by tapping the close icon (x) and selecting “End Upload” to exit the logging session. You can also turn off logging by navigating to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > View Enhanced Logging Session > tap the close icon (x) > and select “End Upload”. You will be able to review the log files prior to sending them to Apple.
