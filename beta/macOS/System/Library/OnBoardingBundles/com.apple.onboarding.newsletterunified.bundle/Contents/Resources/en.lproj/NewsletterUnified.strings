Apple News Newsletters

You may provide Apple with your email address so that we can email you newsletters with the best stories picked by Apple News editors. Apple may use information about your Apple Account, such as your billing zip code, to include local news in your newsletters. You can opt in or out of receiving emails from Apple News and manage your newsletter preferences in the News app. On an iOS or iPadOS device, scroll to the bottom of your Following list, and below Manage, select Notifications & Email. On a Mac, select File > Manage Notifications & Email. You can also opt in or out from wherever you manage your Apple Account settings. You can manage your Apple Account settings in Settings on an iOS or iPadOS device, in System Settings on a Mac, and at account.apple.com.

Apple News Personalized Newsletters

In some countries, you may choose to receive personalized versions of the Apple News newsletters. The personalized newsletters include the best stories picked by Apple News editors, as well as stories picked by the editors that match your interests.

If you choose to receive the personalized newsletters, on-device artificial intelligence will analyze your reading to group you with thousands of other users with similar interests, and information about those interests will be sent to Apple to personalize your newsletters.

Your Apple News reading history is kept on your device. As the aggregated information that is sent to Apple does not reflect which stories you have read, Apple does not know your reading history. If you subscribe to Apple News+, you’ll also receive new issues of the magazines you follow in your email newsletters. The list of Apple News+ channels you follow will be sent to Apple and linked to your Apple Account.

If you do not want to receive the personalized newsletters, you can opt out in the News app. On an iOS or iPadOS device, scroll to the bottom of your Following list, and below Manage select Notifications & Email. On a Mac, select File > Manage Notifications & Email. You can also opt out from wherever you manage your Apple Account settings. You can manage your Apple Account settings in Settings on an iOS or iPadOS device, in System Settings on a Mac, and at account.apple.com.

If you would like to receive the personalized newsletters in countries where they are available, you will need to opt in from the News app. Otherwise, if you opt in from Settings, System Settings, or account.apple.com, you will receive the non-personalized newsletters.
