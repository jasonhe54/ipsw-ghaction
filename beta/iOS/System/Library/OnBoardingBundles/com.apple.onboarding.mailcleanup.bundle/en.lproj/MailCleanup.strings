"FOOTER_TEXT" = "iCloud Mail Cleanup gives you recommendations to help you keep your inbox clean and free up storage. Recommendations are, in part, based on the email category. When accessing your iCloud emails in the Mail app on iOS, categorization processing occurs entirely on device. For iCloud Mail Cleanup, Apple processes that categorization data, along with other iCloud email metadata stored in iCloud, to recommend taking certain actions, such as deleting old promotions, unsubscribing from mailing lists, and more. If you access iCloud Mail on iCloud.com, Apple processes certain email metadata, such as email header information, in order to both categorize iCloud emails, as well as to serve Cleanup recommendations.

You have the ability to turn off iCloud Mail Cleanup on iOS and iCloud.com at any time in settings.
