Visual Intelligence

Visual intelligence can look up information about images. When you use this experience to find out more about an object in the image, Apple may receive a mathematical representation of the image in order to return search results (where available). Apple does not store this information.

Some results about businesses, landmarks, and other places of interest are provided by Apple Maps. For more information about the data collected when you use Apple Maps, visit www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-maps.

You can also use Google Search to look up search results for images, which sends an image from your camera to Google when you press the search button. When you use Google Search, Google’s data privacy policies will apply.

If the ChatGPT extension is enabled, you can send an image to ChatGPT to learn more about the image. For more information about how ChatGPT handles your data, visit www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/chatgpt-extension.
