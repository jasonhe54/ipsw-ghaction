When you submit a report, Apple collects the information you provide in the report, such as answers to questions, descriptions, photos, videos, messages, and emails. Before submitting, you can review and remove any information and attachments that you do not want to include in the report.

Apple also collects your device’s model, operating system version, and language. In some cases, Apple may collect the version of the Apple Intelligence model when you are reporting a concern related to Apple Intelligence.

Apple uses this information to help solve reported concerns, and to develop, improve, and train products and services, including feature-specific models.

Reporting a Concern Related to ChatGPT

If you use the ChatGPT extension and you experience an issue, you can choose separately to provide information related to your reported concern to OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, as well. Apple may provide OpenAI with certain information from or about your report to help fix the concern you identified, including your request (and any materials that you attach to the request), the answer, information about your device and your device settings such as your device type and general location, and the type of issue experienced. Apple shares reports with OpenAI only when you separately choose to provide information to OpenAI, and OpenAI is required to retain this information for a limited period of time only. OpenAI is required to use the information to understand and resolve the reported issue and related issues only. Your feedback will not be tied to your Apple Account when provided to OpenAI, and Apple will remove your name and email address before sharing the report.
