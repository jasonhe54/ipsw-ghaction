Some contraceptive methods, like condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps, create a physical barrier to stop sperm from reaching an egg. Others, like spermicides, block sperm entry into the cervix by reducing sperm’s ability to move. Condoms are the only birth control method that also helps protect against sexually transmitted diseases.
Many contraceptives use the hormones estrogen and progesterone to disrupt ovulation and make it harder for sperm to reach eggs that are released during ovulation. The hormones are taken orally with a pill, absorbed through the skin from a patch, or delivered via injection or implanted device.
One type of intrauterine device (IUD) uses copper rather than hormones to prevent sperm from fertilizing eggs.
Fertility awareness based methods such as standard days method, prevent pregnancy by avoiding intercourse during potential fertile windows in your menstrual cycle. These methods require close attention to where you are in your menstrual cycle, as well as changes in cervical mucus or basal body temperature. Sterilization, both male and female, are permanent forms of contraception that require a procedure.

Sometimes chills can be associated with shivering, particularly in the case of an accompanying infection.
