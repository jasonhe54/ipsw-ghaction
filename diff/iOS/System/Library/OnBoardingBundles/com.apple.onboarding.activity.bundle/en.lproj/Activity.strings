Workout details, like the title or trainer, may reveal sensitive information about your workout, such as whether it’s a prenatal workout. Friends may also receive notifications about your Activity and Workout awards. This information will be available to friends for a short time. You can remove a friend at any point using the Remove Friend option in Sharing. You can also choose to hide your Activity from a friend using the Hide my Activity option.
