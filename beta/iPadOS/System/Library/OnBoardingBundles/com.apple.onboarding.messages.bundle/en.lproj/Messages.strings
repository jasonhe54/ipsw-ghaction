"FOOTER_TEXT" = "Messages is an app that allows users to communicate via SMS, MMS, RCS, iMessage, and Apple Messages for Business. iMessage is an Apple messaging service that can be used to send and receive iMessages in the Messages app on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Vision Pro, or Apple Watch. Messages sent over iMessage can include photos, videos, and other information, and they don’t count against your carrier messaging plan.

We designed iMessage to use end-to-end encryption, so there’s no way for Apple to decrypt the content of your conversations when they are in transit between devices. Attachments you send over iMessage (such as photos or videos) are encrypted so that no one but the sender and receiver(s) can access them. These encrypted attachments may be uploaded to Apple. To improve performance, your device may automatically upload attachments to Apple while you are composing an iMessage. If your message isn’t sent, the attachments are deleted from the server after 30 days. When a passcode or password is set on your iOS, iPadOS, visionOS, or watchOS device, stored messages are encrypted on your device so that they can’t be accessed unless the device has been unlocked.

If you lose cellular connection and lack internet access, an eligible iPhone may prompt you to begin sending and receiving messages over satellite. This enables you to send and receive iMessage and SMS messages over satellite. Friends and family who try sending you an iMessage once you have begun sending and receiving messages over satellite may see that you are messaging over satellite. The sending and receiving of SMS, including when it happens over satellite, is a service provided by your carrier and not Apple.

You can choose to automatically delete your iMessages from your device after 30 days or a year, or to keep them on your device forever. For your convenience, SMS, MMS, RCS, RCS Business Messages, Apple Messages for Business, and iMessages are backed up in iCloud and encrypted if you have enabled either iCloud Backup or Messages in iCloud. You can turn off both iCloud Backup and Messages in iCloud whenever you want. On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, go to Settings > [your name] > iCloud. On your Mac, go to Messages > Settings > iMessage, and deselect Enable Messages in iCloud.

You can sign in to iMessage using your Apple Account, or just your phone number. If you sign in to your Apple Account on your device, you will be signed in to iMessage automatically. Your Apple Account or phone numbers will be shown to the people you contact, and people can reach you using your Apple Account and email addresses or phone numbers on your account. You can select which phone numbers or email addresses you’d like to start new conversations from, and which phone numbers or email addresses you can receive messages and reply from, in iMessage settings. You can add and verify additional Reachable At information from your Apple Account page at account.apple.com. iMessage is intended for communicating with family and friends, and is not for conducting commercial activities or disseminating unwanted messages. iMessage misuse may result in service limitations.

Shared with You works across the system to find the articles, music, TV shows, photos, and more that are shared in Messages conversations, and conveniently surfaces them in apps like Photos, Safari, News, Music, and Podcasts, making it easy to quickly access the information in context. Apple does not have access to marked content without your permission. You can disable Shared with You at any time on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Apps > Messages, then tapping to turn off Shared with You. On your Mac, go to Messages > Settings > Shared with You. You can also control whether each app participates in Shared with You by tapping or selecting it in the Shared with You section.

You can use message filtering to help organize your messages. Screen Unknown Senders sorts messages from senders who are not in your contact list into a separate list, and messages can be further sorted into subcategories.

Additionally, Filter Spam uses a combination of on-device rules, message patterns, and sender lookup to filter out spam from unknown senders. Filtering does not reveal any message content to Apple. Sender lookup does not disclose the message sender or the recipient information to Apple. You can disable the spam filter at any time by going to Settings > Apps > Messages > Filter Spam.

Share Name and Photo allows you to share a name and photo with people you iMessage. You can choose to automatically share with just your contacts, or to be prompted each time. Your shared name and photo will be sent with your next iMessage to the people you share with, and stored on their devices. If you share your name and photo with an iMessage conversation with multiple people, your name and photo will be sent to all the people in the conversation. You can update your name and photo at any time. If you automatically share, updates will be sent when you next send an iMessage to each person you share with. If you have shared your name and photo and later turn off sharing, others who previously received your name and photo may still have your information on their devices. The name and photo you select for messages will be sent to Apple, and stored on Apple’s servers encrypted in a way that Apple cannot see.

Apple may record and store some information related to your use of the Messages app and the iMessage service to operate and improve Apple’s products and services:

• Apple may record and store information about your use of iMessage in a way that doesn’t identify you, including when you send and receive messages over satellite.

• Apple may store information sent to Apple when you or someone else reports spam or junk. Apple may store and use information contained in or related to spam and junk message reports for fraud and abuse prevention purposes.

• Apple may store iMessages that are scheduled to be delivered, or that can’t be delivered, for up to 30 days for delivery.

• Some apps on your device (including Messages) may communicate with Apple’s servers to determine whether other people can be reached by iMessage. When this happens, Apple may store these phone numbers and email addresses associated with your account, for up to 30 days.

By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information as described above.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
