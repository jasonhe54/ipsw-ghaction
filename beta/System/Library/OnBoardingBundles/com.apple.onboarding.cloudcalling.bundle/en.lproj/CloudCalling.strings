If you enable WLAN Calling and connect to a WLAN network from a WLAN Calling–enabled device, information about the country where your network connection is made, based on your IP address (or cellular network if applicable), may be sent to your carrier for billing and service availability purposes. If you do not want to share this information with your carrier, you may turn off WLAN Calling on your iPhone and for your other devices, including your paired Apple Watch, by going to Settings > Apps > Phone, and tapping to turn off WLAN Calling on This iPhone and tapping to turn off Add WLAN Calling For Other Devices. To turn off WLAN Calling on your other devices that have WLAN Calling enabled, on your iPhone go to Settings > Apps > Phone > Calls on Other Devices and tap to turn off Allow Calls on Other Devices, then in the list of devices, tap to turn off the individual devices.

In order for your carrier to complete short code calls (calls to abbreviated numbers that provide access to public services) via WLAN or cellular data, Apple must provide the city from which the call is placed to your carrier to help them properly route the call. If you do not want to share the city you are calling from with your carrier when making short code calls, you may turn off Location Services for WLAN Calling on your iOS or watchOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services, and tapping to turn off WLAN Calling. You can turn off Location Services for WLAN Calling on your Mac by going to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services, then clicking Details next to System Services and clicking to turn off WLAN calling. If you turn off Location Services for WLAN Calling, your device will not be able to determine or send the city you are in to your carrier when you dial a short code number for a WLAN call, and as a result, your carrier may not be able to properly route or connect your call.

Emergency calls on your iPhone are routed through cellular service when available. In the event that cellular service is not available and you have enabled WLAN Calling, emergency calls may be made over WLAN, and your device’s location information may be used for emergency calls to aid response efforts regardless of whether you enable Location Services. However, your carrier may choose to use your billing address or other address you provide to your carrier for the purpose of routing emergency services. You may update your address information for your carrier in Settings on your iOS devices and in FaceTime Settings on your Mac. You should keep this information up to date. Failing to do so may prevent emergency services from being properly routed to your physical location. For location reliability reasons, it is preferable to make emergency calls over traditional cellular or fixed line services, and only use WLAN Calling features for such calls as a last resort.

For more information about WLAN Calling, refer to your carrier’s terms, privacy policy, and practices. At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy.";
