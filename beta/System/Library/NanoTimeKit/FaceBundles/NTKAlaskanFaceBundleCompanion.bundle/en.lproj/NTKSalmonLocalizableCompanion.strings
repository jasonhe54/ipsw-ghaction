"FACE_STYLE_SALMON_DESCRIPTION" = "Inspired by classic watches that show the difference between local and Greenwich Mean Time, this face has two dials: a 12-hour inner dial that displays local time, and a 24-hour outer dial that lets you track a second time zone. Choose from a list of curated city names, or add one from your World Clock list. The duotone colors of the face reflect day and night, as well as sunrise and sunset times of your chosen city.";
